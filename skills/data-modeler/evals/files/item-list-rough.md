# Infinite Voyage — Rough Item List

Here are the items we've been kicking around for the Alpha build. Stats are approximate, feel free to adjust for balance. We need these turned into a proper item database table.

## Weapons

1. **Plasma Cutter** — basic sidearm every Navigator starts with. Around 12 damage, no special effects. Common. Should be buyable for like 50 credits at any station. Weighs almost nothing.

2. **Void Lance** — long-range energy rifle. Hits hard, maybe 35-40 damage? Rare drop from Nebula Stalkers. Thinking it should have a "Pierce Shields" effect that ignores 20% of target shield value. Level 10 requirement. Probably 800 credits to buy, if we even let vendors sell it.

3. **Graviton Hammer** — melee weapon for Vanguard class. Huge damage (50+), slow swing. Epic rarity. Drops from the Asteroid Colossus boss at maybe 4% rate. Special effect: knockback on hit. Level 15 to equip. Not tradeable — soulbound.

4. **Nano Blade** — fast melee dagger for Phantoms. Low damage per hit (8-10) but attacks twice per turn. Uncommon. Craftable from 2x Nano Fiber + 1x Starlight Alloy. Around 200 credits to craft. Level 5.

## Armor

5. **Starweave Suit** — basic armor, everyone can wear it. 5 defense, nothing fancy. Common. Stations sell it for 75 credits. Stackable? No, it's armor. Weighs 3 units.

6. **Exo-Shell Mk II** — heavy armor for Vanguards. 18 defense, reduces movement speed by 10%. Rare. Level 12. Drops from Orbital Sentinels (6% drop rate). About 600 credits value. Tradeable.

7. **Phantom Cloak** — light armor that boosts dodge by 15%. Only 3 defense but that dodge is insane. Epic. Level 20. Crafted: 4x Shadow Silk + 2x Void Essence + 1x Phantom Core. Costs 1500 credits to craft. NOT tradeable.

## Consumables

8. **Repair Nano-Kit** — heals 50 HP. Common consumable, stacks up to 20. Every station sells them for 25 credits. No level requirement. Drops from basically everything at 15% rate.

9. **Shield Overcharge Cell** — temporarily doubles shield capacity for 3 turns. Rare consumable. Stacks to 5. Level 8 to use. Drops from Techno-Drones at 3%. Buy for 300 credits. Can be traded.

## Misc

10. **Star Map Fragment** — quest item, not really tradeable or sellable. Legendary rarity because there are only 7 in the game. Collecting all 7 unlocks the hidden Void Gate sector. No stats, no level req, no weight. Just a key item.
