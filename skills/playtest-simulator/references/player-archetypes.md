# Player Archetype Profiles

Detailed behavioral profiles for virtual playtesting. Each archetype
represents a statistically significant player segment observed across RPG audiences. Use
these profiles to simulate realistic player behavior during playtest scenarios.

## 1. The Optimizer (Min-Maxer)

### Core Motivation
Mastery through efficiency. The Optimizer wants to solve the game as a system, finding
the mathematically best path through every challenge. Winning is not enough -- winning
optimally is the goal.

### Playstyle
- Reads patch notes, wikis, and community spreadsheets before playing
- Calculates DPS, EHP, gold-per-hour, and XP-per-minute for every activity
- Skips cutscenes, dialogue, and flavor text unless they contain gameplay hints
- Rerolls characters if the starting build is suboptimal
- Gravitates toward whatever the current "meta" build is
- Will exploit unintended interactions if they provide an edge

### Pain Points
- Mandatory slow content with no skip option (unskippable cutscenes, forced walking)
- Systems where the "correct" choice is unclear due to hidden information
- Balance patches that invalidate invested builds without compensation
- RNG-gated progression where skill and planning cannot reduce variance
- Poorly documented mechanics that require trial-and-error instead of calculation

### Feature Preferences
- Detailed stat tooltips with exact formulas
- DPS meters, combat logs, and performance tracking
- Build planners and respec options
- Leaderboards and ranking systems
- Deterministic crafting over random outcomes

### Session Length
Typically 2-4 hours per session. Will play longer during new content drops or when
optimizing a new build. Sessions are focused and goal-directed.

### Spending Patterns
Spends on power and convenience: XP boosts, inventory expansion, respec tokens.
Avoids cosmetics unless they signal achievement. Will pay for anything that saves
time on non-optimization tasks.

### Churn Triggers
- Discovery that the meta is stale with no viable alternatives
- Balance changes that feel arbitrary or punish investment
- Content drought with nothing left to optimize
- Realization that the game has a hard ceiling where optimization stops mattering
- Pay-to-win mechanics that bypass the optimization challenge

## 2. The Explorer

### Core Motivation
Discovery and wonder. The Explorer wants to see everything the world has to offer,
uncover its secrets, and understand its lore. The journey matters more than the
destination.

### Playstyle
- Goes off the critical path at every opportunity
- Reads every book, journal entry, and environmental story detail
- Tries unusual item combinations and interacts with everything
- Maps areas mentally, remembers landmarks, notices environmental changes
- Frequently backtracks to check if earlier areas changed after story events
- Takes screenshots and shares discoveries with others

### Pain Points
- Invisible walls, locked doors with no explanation, and arbitrary boundaries
- Empty areas that look explorable but contain nothing
- Curiosity that goes unrewarded (reaching a difficult ledge with nothing on it)
- Lore inconsistencies or plot holes
- Fast-travel systems that discourage walking through the world

### Feature Preferences
- Rich environmental storytelling and discoverable lore
- Hidden areas, secret passages, and optional content
- Photo mode and scenic vistas
- Achievements for discovery and exploration milestones
- A world that reacts to player presence (NPCs commenting, environment changing)

### Session Length
Long sessions of 3-6 hours, often longer. Will lose track of time when exploring.
Sessions are unstructured and meandering -- they go wherever curiosity leads.

### Spending Patterns
Spends on cosmetics, housing, and content expansions. Will purchase DLC that adds
new areas to explore. Less interested in power boosts. Values aesthetic items and
collectibles.

### Churn Triggers
- Running out of new areas to discover
- Realizing the world is shallow (beautiful but empty)
- Being forced through linear corridors for too long
- Community spoilers that remove the joy of discovery
- Exploration that feels punished (wandering into instant-death zones with no warning)

## 3. The Casual

### Core Motivation
Relaxation and enjoyment. The Casual plays to unwind, experience a story, and feel
a sense of progress without stress. Games should be fun, not a second job.

### Playstyle
- Follows quest markers and the main story path
- Uses recommended or default builds; rarely customizes deeply
- Plays in short sessions, often with interruptions
- Forgets complex mechanics between sessions
- Picks the dialogue option that feels right emotionally
- Will lower difficulty if stuck rather than retry many times

### Pain Points
- Difficulty spikes with no warning or difficulty adjustment option
- Complex mechanics introduced without adequate tutorials
- Punishing death penalties that erase progress
- Unclear objectives ("find the artifact" with no map marker)
- Long mandatory dungeons with no save points
- Overwhelming UI with too many stats, meters, and systems

### Feature Preferences
- Clear quest markers and objective tracking
- Difficulty settings with no shame for choosing easy
- Auto-save and generous checkpoints
- Simple, satisfying combat that does not require frame-perfect inputs
- Recap systems ("previously in your adventure...")
- Pause-friendly (no penalties for going AFK)

### Session Length
Short sessions of 30-90 minutes. May play daily but in small chunks. Sessions end
at natural stopping points (quest completion, reaching a town).

### Spending Patterns
Impulse purchases on cosmetics and convenience items. Will buy a cute pet or a cool
outfit. Spends on story DLC if they enjoyed the base game. Price-sensitive -- prefers
small purchases over large ones.

### Churn Triggers
- Feeling stuck with no clear path forward
- A difficulty spike that feels unfair
- Losing significant progress to a crash or death penalty
- The game demanding more time than they have
- Feeling judged for not being "good enough" (harsh failure states)
- Returning after a break and being completely lost

## 4. The Completionist

### Core Motivation
Total mastery and closure. The Completionist wants to see 100% on every progress
bar, collect every item, finish every quest, and unlock every achievement. Leaving
content undone feels like leaving a book half-read.

### Playstyle
- Systematic area-by-area coverage before advancing the main story
- Maintains mental or physical checklists of tasks
- Revisits cleared areas to check for missed items after gaining new abilities
- Reads guides to ensure they do not miss missable content
- Grinds willingly if there is a progress indicator showing advancement
- Agonizes over branching paths that lock out content

### Pain Points
- Missable content with no warning (one-chance quests, timed events)
- Achievements that require specific builds, locking out other achievements
- Progress tracking that is incomplete or inaccurate
- Extreme RNG gating on collectibles (0.1% drop rate items)
- Content that requires multiplayer when they prefer solo
- Ambiguous completion conditions ("explore the region" -- how much is enough?)

### Feature Preferences
- Comprehensive achievement and collectible tracking systems
- Area completion percentages and checklists
- New Game Plus that carries over completion progress
- Clear indication of missable vs. repeatable content
- Statistics pages (playtime, kills, items found, percentage complete)

### Session Length
Long sessions of 3-5 hours, highly structured. Will set goals for each session
("tonight I clear the forest region to 100%"). Total playtime is typically 2-3x
the average player.

### Spending Patterns
Will buy any DLC or expansion that adds completable content. Purchases guides,
maps, and tracking tools. Less interested in cosmetics unless they are collectible.
Will spend money to avoid missable content (buying items from limited-time shops).

### Churn Triggers
- Discovering that 100% completion is impossible or bugged
- Missable content they already missed with no way to recover
- An update that adds unobtainable achievements retroactively
- Grind requirements that cross from satisfying into tedious (hundreds of hours)
- Multiplayer-gated achievements when matchmaking is dead

## 5. The Socializer

### Core Motivation
Shared experience and connection. The Socializer plays games as a social platform --
the game is a backdrop for relationships, cooperation, and community. The best moments
are the ones shared with others.

### Playstyle
- Seeks group content: parties, guilds, raids, co-op quests
- Prioritizes cosmetics and visible status symbols
- Helps new players, mentors, and organizes community events
- Splits attention between gameplay and chat/voice communication
- Makes suboptimal gameplay choices for social reasons (plays healer because the group needs one)
- Values memorable shared experiences over personal achievement

### Pain Points
- Mandatory solo content that blocks multiplayer progression
- No way to show off accomplishments to others (no cosmetics, no titles)
- Toxic community tools (open world PvP griefing, no report system)
- Group content that punishes one player's mistake with a full wipe
- Lack of social spaces (no hubs, no housing, no gathering areas)
- LFG systems that are cumbersome or non-functional

### Feature Preferences
- Guild systems with ranks, banks, and group goals
- Cosmetic and housing systems for self-expression
- Emotes, poses, and social animations
- Trading and gifting between players
- Group finder and matchmaking tools
- Spectator mode and shared achievements

### Session Length
Variable, 1-4 hours, depending on social engagement. Will play for 6+ hours if
the social group is active. Will log off quickly if playing alone.

### Spending Patterns
Heaviest cosmetic spenders. Buys outfits, mounts, housing items, and gifts for
friends. Will spend to look unique or to support a guild. Social status drives
purchasing more than gameplay advantage.

### Churn Triggers
- Friends leaving the game (single biggest churn factor)
- Toxic community with insufficient moderation tools
- No meaningful group content at endgame
- Solo-mandatory progression gates that split them from their group
- Lack of social features (no guilds, no chat, no gathering spaces)
- Server merges or transfers that break their social network

## 6. The Speedrunner

### Core Motivation
Mastery through speed. The Speedrunner wants to complete content in the absolute
minimum time possible. Every second saved is a victory. The game is a puzzle where
the solution is the fastest route.

### Playstyle
- Skips all optional content, dialogue, and cutscenes
- Memorizes exact routes, timings, and spawn patterns
- Actively searches for sequence breaks, clip-throughs, and movement exploits
- Uses frame-precise inputs and animation cancels
- Resets runs dozens of times to get the perfect start
- Studies game code, memory values, and engine quirks

### Pain Points
- Unskippable cutscenes, animations, or loading screens
- RNG that cannot be manipulated or accounted for (random enemy spawns on the route)
- Anti-exploit patches that remove established speedrun strategies
- Mandatory waiting periods (real-time gates, cooldown timers)
- Forced slow-walk segments or speed-limited areas
- Checkpoints that cannot be skipped or reset quickly

### Feature Preferences
- Skippable cutscenes and dialogues (frame 1 skip, not "hold to skip")
- Precise movement controls with high skill ceiling
- In-game timer and split tracking
- Quick restart options
- Consistent, deterministic game behavior (minimal RNG)
- Ghost/replay systems to compare runs

### Session Length
Highly variable. Practice sessions run 1-2 hours. Serious attempts can last 4-8
hours with hundreds of resets. Very goal-focused -- will stop immediately when
a target time is achieved or when fatigue degrades performance.

### Spending Patterns
Minimal spending. The game itself is the product. Will not pay for cosmetics,
power, or convenience. May purchase the game multiple times on different platforms
for version-specific glitches. Contributes to community resources and leaderboards.

### Churn Triggers
- Patches that remove major skips or glitches without adding new routing options
- Unskippable content being added to the main path
- The game becoming "solved" with no further time to save
- Poor leaderboard integrity (cheated times, no verification)
- Community fracturing over rule disputes
- Engine changes that alter fundamental movement mechanics

## Archetype Overlap Matrix

Most real players are a blend of archetypes. Common combinations:

| Primary        | Common Secondary | Behavior Blend                                      |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Optimizer      | Completionist   | Must 100% everything, but only via the optimal path |
| Explorer       | Casual          | Wanderers who explore at a relaxed pace             |
| Completionist  | Explorer        | Must find every secret and every hidden area        |
| Socializer     | Casual          | Plays for friends, not for challenge                |
| Optimizer      | Speedrunner     | Optimizes for time rather than power                |
| Casual         | Socializer      | Plays co-op with friends on easy mode               |

## Using Archetypes in Simulation

When running a playtest simulation:

1. **Select archetypes** relevant to the content being tested
2. **Adopt the mindset** fully -- do not let your designer brain override the archetype
3. **Follow their priorities** even when it leads to "wrong" choices
4. **Note friction points** specific to that archetype's values
5. **Rate satisfaction** on their terms, not yours
6. **Document surprises** -- moments where the archetype would react unexpectedly

The goal is not to play perfectly but to play authentically as each type of person
who will experience your game.
