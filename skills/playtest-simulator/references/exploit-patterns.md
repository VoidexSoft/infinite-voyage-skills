# Common Game Exploit Patterns

A catalog of exploit categories encountered in RPGs, with detection heuristics and
prevention strategies. Use this reference when simulating Optimizer and Speedrunner
archetypes to systematically check for vulnerabilities in Infinite Voyage designs.

## 1. Duplication Glitches

### Description
Exploits that allow players to copy items, currency, or resources, creating something
from nothing. Duplication breaks economies and trivializes progression.

### Common Vectors
- **Drop-and-pickup race conditions:** Dropping an item while simultaneously performing
  another action (trading, storing, using) creates two copies
- **Save/load manipulation:** Saving mid-transaction, completing it, reloading, and
  completing it again to receive rewards twice
- **Desync exploits (multiplayer):** Network latency between client and server allows
  both parties in a trade to retain the traded item
- **Container transfer bugs:** Moving items between inventory, storage, and mail
  simultaneously causes the item to exist in multiple locations
- **Craft-cancel exploits:** Starting a craft, canceling mid-process, but retaining
  both the materials and the partial product

### Detection Heuristics
- Monitor total resource quantities across all player storage (inventory + bank + mail + AH)
- Flag accounts where item count increases without a valid source event
- Track economy-wide item counts -- if total gold exceeds expected generation, duplication is occurring
- Log all item creation/destruction events and audit trails
- Watch for sudden spikes in specific item quantities from a single account

### Prevention Strategies
- Use server-authoritative item management -- client never decides item counts
- Implement transaction locks: no concurrent operations on the same item
- Add cooldowns between drop/pickup/trade actions on the same item
- Validate item counts before and after every transaction
- Use unique item instance IDs that are tracked through their full lifecycle

## 2. Economy Exploits

### Description
Exploits that generate unbounded wealth through legitimate-looking game systems.
These arise when economic loops have a net-positive return.

### Common Vectors
- **Buy-sell arbitrage:** Buying from one vendor and selling to another at a higher
  price, or buying at base price and selling crafted output for more than material cost
- **Infinite crafting loops:** Crafting an item, salvaging it for more materials than
  it cost, and repeating indefinitely
- **Quest reward farming:** Repeatable quests where the reward exceeds the cost of
  completion (time, consumables, travel)
- **Currency conversion loops:** Converting between currency types in a cycle that
  nets positive value (gold to gems to tokens to gold, gaining value each step)
- **Market manipulation:** Cornering supply of a crafting material to inflate prices,
  then dumping stock

### Detection Heuristics
- Graph all resource conversion paths and check for positive-sum cycles
- Monitor gold-per-hour by player and flag outliers (3+ standard deviations above mean)
- Track vendor buy/sell ratios -- if any item sells for more than it buys, that is exploitable
- Audit crafting recipes: output_value must be less than input_value + labor_cost
- Watch for players repeating the same short action loop thousands of times

### Prevention Strategies
- Ensure all vendor buy prices are strictly lower than sell prices (typically 50% or less)
- Make salvage returns random and always less than crafting cost on average
- Add diminishing returns to repeatable quest rewards
- Model the full economy as a directed graph and verify no positive cycles exist
- Implement anti-farming throttles on repeatable gold sources

## 3. Progression Skips

### Description
Exploits that allow players to access content, areas, or power levels before they
were intended to be available.

### Common Vectors
- **Level requirement bypasses:** Equipping high-level gear through trade, mail, or
  shared storage without meeting the level requirement
- **Quest prerequisite skips:** Entering a quest area through unintended geometry
  access, bypassing the quest-giver entirely
- **XP overflow:** Stacking XP multipliers or bonuses to gain levels far faster
  than intended, reaching endgame in hours
- **Shared account boosting:** A high-level player completing content on a
  low-level character's behalf through account sharing
- **Gate bypass:** Using movement exploits to get past locked doors, barriers,
  or progression gates

### Detection Heuristics
- Track time-to-level metrics and flag players reaching milestones significantly
  faster than design targets
- Verify equipment level requirements are checked server-side at equip time, not
  just at purchase
- Monitor zone entry events against quest completion flags
- Log ability/skill unlocks and verify prerequisite chains are complete
- Compare player power level against content difficulty for the area they are in

### Prevention Strategies
- Server-side validation of all prerequisites (level, quest, achievement) at every gate
- Equipment checks on every stat calculation tick, not just on equip
- Zone boundary enforcement through server-authoritative position tracking
- XP gain caps per time period with diminishing returns on repeated content
- Clear separation between "intended skip" (New Game Plus, catch-up mechanics) and exploit

## 4. AI Manipulation

### Description
Exploits that abuse enemy AI behavior patterns to trivialize combat encounters.

### Common Vectors
- **Kiting:** Moving just outside enemy attack range while attacking, so the enemy
  never lands a hit. Common when melee enemies have no ranged attacks or gap closers
- **Geometry stuck:** Luring enemies into terrain features (doorways, rocks, ledges)
  where their pathfinding breaks and they stand still
- **Leash abuse:** Pulling an enemy to the edge of its leash range, where it tries
  to return and the player can attack it freely during the reset animation
- **Aggro ping-pong:** Two players alternating aggro so the enemy spends all its
  time turning between them and never attacks
- **Spawn camping:** Killing enemies at their spawn point before they fully activate,
  preventing them from using abilities
- **LoS (Line of Sight) abuse:** Breaking line of sight to force ranged enemies into
  melee range or to reset their attack sequence

### Detection Heuristics
- Track enemy damage dealt vs. damage taken ratios per encounter. If enemies deal
  near-zero damage consistently, AI is being exploited
- Monitor enemy "stuck" states -- time spent not moving or attacking
- Log leash resets per enemy and flag frequent resets from the same player
- Track average combat duration vs. expected duration for the encounter
- Monitor player position relative to enemy during combat (always at max range = kiting)

### Prevention Strategies
- Give melee enemies ranged attacks or gap-closing abilities
- Implement anti-stuck detection that teleports or resets stuck enemies
- Make leash resets heal the enemy to full and grant temporary damage immunity
- Add enrage timers to prevent indefinite kiting
- Use navmesh validation to prevent enemies from being lured into broken geometry
- Give bosses anti-exploit mechanics (AoE attacks, phase transitions, arena boundaries)

## 5. Boundary Breaks

### Description
Exploits that allow players to leave the intended play area by moving through, over,
or around world geometry.

### Common Vectors
- **Wall clipping:** Using specific movement abilities, animations, or camera angles
  to pass through solid geometry
- **Ledge boosting:** Combining jump and movement tech to reach unintended heights
- **Mount/vehicle exploits:** Mounted movement having different collision than on-foot,
  allowing passage through barriers
- **Death warping:** Dying in a specific location and respawning on the other side
  of a barrier
- **Object surfing:** Standing on a moving object (elevator, platform, NPC) that
  carries the player through collision boundaries
- **Loading zone manipulation:** Triggering a zone transition while in an unintended
  position, spawning in the wrong location

### Detection Heuristics
- Define valid play area boundaries and flag players outside them
- Track player position history and flag impossible movement (teleportation-like jumps)
- Monitor height values -- flag players above the maximum intended height for a zone
- Log zone entry points and verify they match valid entry coordinates
- Watch for players in zones they have not unlocked access to

### Prevention Strategies
- Use kill planes below and around the world to catch out-of-bounds players
- Double-sided collision on critical barriers (walls, floors, ceilings)
- Server-side position validation with rubber-banding for invalid positions
- Regular collision audits of world geometry, especially near transitions
- Invisible blocking volumes around known exploit-prone geometry
- Respawn players at the nearest valid position if they reach an invalid state

## 6. Sequence Breaks

### Description
Exploits that allow players to complete content out of the designers' intended order,
potentially skipping prerequisites or accessing rewards early.

### Common Vectors
- **Objective skip:** Completing a quest's final step without doing intermediate steps
  (killing the boss before talking to the quest-giver)
- **Backtracking access:** Entering an area through its exit rather than its intended
  entrance, bypassing puzzles or encounters
- **Trigger manipulation:** Activating quest triggers out of order by reaching specific
  coordinates or interacting with specific objects before prerequisites
- **Dialogue skips:** Interrupting NPC conversations at specific frames to set quest
  flags without completing the full dialogue tree
- **Ability-gated access:** Using a late-game ability obtained through trading or
  boosting to access an area meant for later in the game

### Detection Heuristics
- Track quest step completion order and flag out-of-sequence completions
- Monitor area access events against prerequisite completion flags
- Log trigger activations with timestamps and verify logical ordering
- Audit quest reward grants against required step completions
- Track player ability acquisition order against intended unlock sequence

### Prevention Strategies
- Strictly gate quest steps server-side: step N+1 requires step N completion
- Use area-entry validation beyond just physical barriers (server checks)
- Design quests with hard dependencies: the boss literally does not spawn until
  the preceding step is complete
- Test all content with Speedrunner archetype specifically looking for sequence breaks
- Consider whether some sequence breaks are acceptable or even desirable (player agency)

## 7. Stat Overflow

### Description
Exploits that push stat values beyond intended limits, often into game-breaking territory,
through stacking, overflow, or edge-case math.

### Common Vectors
- **Buff stacking:** Applying the same buff multiple times when it should not stack,
  or stacking different buffs that multiply each other exponentially
- **Integer overflow:** Pushing a stat value past the maximum integer value, causing
  it to wrap to negative or zero (e.g., armor so high it becomes negative)
- **Percentage stacking:** Combining multiple percentage-based bonuses that multiply
  rather than add (10% + 10% + 10% = 33% multiplicative, not 30% additive)
- **Temporary buff permanence:** Making a temporary buff permanent through specific
  timing of save/load, zone transitions, or death/respawn
- **Negative stat exploits:** Reducing a stat below zero to cause unexpected behavior
  (negative armor increasing damage taken beyond 100%, wrapping to damage dealt)

### Detection Heuristics
- Set hard caps on all stats and log any attempt to exceed them
- Monitor damage numbers and flag values that exceed theoretical maximums
- Track active buff counts per player and flag unusual stacking
- Audit stat calculation pipelines for overflow potential at extreme values
- Test all formulas with boundary values: 0, 1, MAX_INT, -1, MAX_INT+1

### Prevention Strategies
- Implement hard caps on all stats with server-side enforcement
- Use additive stacking by default; only use multiplicative when intentional
- Clamp all stat values to valid ranges after every calculation
- Use data types large enough to prevent overflow (64-bit for currencies)
- Categorize buffs and enforce "strongest wins" within each category
- Test all stat formulas with extreme values during development

## 8. Timing and Desync Exploits

### Description
Exploits that abuse timing windows, network latency, or synchronization gaps between
client and server.

### Common Vectors
- **Action canceling:** Canceling an attack animation after the damage is applied but
  before the cooldown starts, allowing faster attack rates
- **Lag switching:** Deliberately inducing network lag to desync from the server,
  performing actions during the lag window, then reconnecting
- **Double-action window:** Performing two mutually exclusive actions in the same frame
  or tick (attacking and blocking simultaneously)
- **Timer manipulation:** Changing system clock to affect time-gated content
  (daily quests, cooldown timers, event schedules)
- **Race conditions:** Two players performing conflicting actions on the same object
  simultaneously, causing both to succeed

### Detection Heuristics
- Monitor actions-per-second and flag players exceeding humanly possible input rates
- Track latency spikes and correlate with unusual gameplay events
- Log all action timestamps server-side and verify physical possibility
- Use server time for all game timers, never client time
- Monitor simultaneous interactions with shared objects and validate outcomes

### Prevention Strategies
- Server-authoritative action validation with server-side cooldown tracking
- Disconnect players with sustained high latency or frequent disconnects during
  competitive content
- Animation-locked actions: the server enforces the full animation duration
- All timers use server time exclusively
- Mutex locks on shared objects preventing simultaneous modification
- Rollback networking for competitive interactions

## Exploit Severity Classification

When an exploit is discovered during simulation, classify it:

| Severity   | Criteria                                                      | Response Priority |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Critical   | Breaks economy, enables infinite resources, crashes server    | Fix before launch |
| High       | Trivializes significant content, unfair PvP advantage         | Fix in next patch  |
| Medium     | Skips intended content but does not break systems             | Schedule fix       |
| Low        | Minor advantage, self-limiting, does not affect other players | Monitor and track  |
| Acceptable | Emergent gameplay that enriches the experience                | Document, keep     |

## Applying This Reference

During playtest simulation, run through each category above as a checklist for the
content being tested. For each exploit type, ask:

1. Does this content create an opportunity for this exploit type?
2. If so, how would an Optimizer discover and execute it?
3. What is the severity if exploited?
4. What prevention can be designed in from the start?

Prevention at design time is always cheaper than patching after launch.
