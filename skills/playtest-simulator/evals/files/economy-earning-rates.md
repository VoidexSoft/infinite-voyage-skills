## Economy Health Targets

### Ideal State
- Player should never feel "broke" for more than 30 minutes of gameplay
- Essential spending should consume no more than 40% of average income
- At least 1 meaningful purchase available every 2-3 hours
- Cosmetic spending should feel like a treat, not a burden

### Warning Signs
- **Inflation:** If AC/hour exceeds 1,500 sustained, prices lose meaning
- **Deflation:** If AC/hour drops below 300 sustained, player feels stuck
- **Gating:** If a required purchase takes more than 2 hours of dedicated farming, frustration spikes
- **Exploit ceiling:** If any repeatable activity exceeds 1,200 AC/hour, Optimizers will farm it exclusively

### Currency Sinks
| Sink | Drain Rate | Target |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Ship fuel | 50-150 AC/hour | Steady drain, prevents hoarding |
| Crew salary | ~30 AC/hour (amortized) | Background drain |
| Repair costs | 50-100 AC/hour (combat players) | Scales with risk-taking |
| Crafting failures | 20% material loss on fail | Material sink, not AC directly |
| Auction house tax | 10% on sales | Removes AC from economy |
| Respec cost | Increases by 100 AC each use | Discourages frivolous respeccing |

## Secondary Currencies

| Currency | Earned From | Spent On | Exchange Rate |
|----------|------------|----------|---------------|
| Void Shards | Void encounters, secrets | Void-tier equipment, lore unlocks | Not tradeable; no AC conversion |
| Reputation tokens (per faction) | Faction quests, choices | Faction vendors, rank unlocks | Not tradeable |
| Arena Points | PvP matches | PvP cosmetics, titles | Not tradeable |
| Crafting Materials | Salvage, drops, gathering | Equipment crafting | Tradeable on player market |

**Design intent:** Secondary currencies prevent Optimizers from converting all progression into a single grindable resource. Each currency requires engaging with its specific content pillar.
