# Environmental Storytelling Techniques

Reference guide for conveying narrative, history, and world-building through the design
of the environment itself. Environmental storytelling allows players to discover story
at their own pace and rewards attentive exploration.

---

## Core Principle

Environmental storytelling is showing, not telling. The arrangement of objects, the state
of a space, and the sensory atmosphere communicate what happened here without requiring
dialogue or text. A well-designed room tells its story to every player who looks, and
reveals deeper layers to those who look closely.

---

## 1. Visual Cues

Visual composition directs the player's eye and communicates meaning through what they see.

### Sight Lines and Framing

| Technique | How It Works | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Leading lines** | Architectural elements point toward the subject | Collapsed pillars form an arrow toward a hidden alcove |
| **Framing** | Doorways, arches, or gaps frame important objects | A broken window perfectly frames a distant castle |
| **Contrast** | A unique element stands out from surroundings | A single red flower in a field of ash |
| **Scale** | Oversized or undersized elements convey importance or vulnerability | A tiny shrine beneath an enormous statue |
| **Negative space** | Empty areas draw attention to what is present | A bare pedestal where a stolen artifact once stood |

### Color as Narrative

| Color Usage | Narrative Meaning | Example |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| Warm light in cold space | Safety, life, hope | Candlelight in a frozen cave indicates someone was here recently |
| Desaturated environment | Decay, abandonment, death | A once-vibrant garden now grey and withered |
| Single bright color | Importance, danger, or magic | Glowing blue runes on an otherwise dark wall |
| Color gradient across space | Transition, contamination, influence | Healthy forest gradually turns corrupted purple near the villain's lair |
| Matching colors | Faction or ownership | All bandit camps use the same red-and-black palette |

### Weathering and Wear

Objects tell their age through visual deterioration:

- **Fresh damage** (splintered wood, wet blood, smoking rubble) -- Something happened recently
- **Old damage** (rust, moss, faded stains) -- This happened long ago
- **Maintained vs. neglected** -- Polished surfaces mean someone cares for this place
- **Layered damage** -- Multiple events over time (old cracks with new burns on top)

---

## 2. Item Placement

The position, grouping, and state of objects tell stories about the people who used them.

### Arrangement Patterns

| Pattern | Story Implication | Example |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| **Items clustered together** | Someone was using these, possibly interrupted | Alchemy supplies scattered mid-brew, chair knocked over |
| **Items in a line or path** | Someone was traveling or escaping | Dropped supplies leading toward a cliff edge |
| **Items neatly organized** | Deliberate placement, ritual, or preparation | Weapons laid out ceremonially before a shrine |
| **Items barricading a door** | Desperation, defense against something | Furniture stacked against a door with claw marks on the other side |
| **Single item out of place** | Clue, mistake, or planted evidence | A noble's ring in a commoner's home |

### Readable Object States

| Object State | Narrative Signal |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Open book face-down | Reader was interrupted or left in a hurry |
| Half-eaten meal | Sudden departure, ambush, or death |
| Lit candle with no one present | Someone is nearby or was here very recently |
| Extinguished campfire (cold) | Camp was abandoned some time ago |
| Extinguished campfire (warm embers) | Camp was abandoned very recently |
| Empty weapon rack | Inhabitants armed themselves (prepared for battle) |
| Full weapon rack in an abandoned space | Inhabitants did not have time to arm themselves |
| Locked chest among scattered loot | Contains something the owner valued above all else |

### Personal Effects as Character

Objects can humanize absent characters:

- A child's toy in a soldier's camp -- This warrior has a family
- A journal with entries growing increasingly erratic -- Mental deterioration
- Matching lockets found in two different locations -- A separated couple
- Well-worn boots beside a bed -- Someone who traveled far to reach this place
- A half-written letter -- Interrupted or unable to finish

---

## 3. Destruction Patterns

How a space was damaged reveals what happened there.

### Damage Type Analysis

| Damage Type | Physical Signs | Narrative Implication |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Fire** | Char marks, melted metal, ash, smoke stains | Arson, dragon attack, magical destruction |
| **Explosion** | Radial debris pattern, crater, shattered outward | Magical detonation, trapped chest, sabotage |
| **Siege** | Broken walls from outside, projectile impacts, barricades | Military assault, organized attack |
| **Internal collapse** | Structural failure, cracked foundations, sagging ceilings | Age, neglect, earthquake, underground tunneling |
| **Claw/bite marks** | Organic gouges, tooth marks, torn fabric | Beast or monster attack |
| **Blade marks** | Clean cuts, sword gouges in wood/stone | Combat, execution, practiced violence |
| **Corrosion** | Dissolved surfaces, acid burns, pitted metal | Alchemical disaster, acidic creature, poison |
| **Frost** | Frozen surfaces, ice crystals, preserved organic matter | Ice magic, supernatural cold, long-dead environment |

### Battle Scene Reconstruction

When designing a space where a battle occurred, place elements that let the player
reconstruct the sequence of events:

1. **Entry point** -- Where did the attackers come from? (broken door, shattered window)
2. **Defense line** -- Where did the defenders make their stand? (overturned tables, barricades)
3. **Fallen defenders** -- Bodies or skeletons positioned behind cover, weapons in hand
4. **Fallen attackers** -- Bodies near the entry point or caught in traps
5. **Last stand** -- A final position where the outcome was decided
6. **Aftermath** -- Looting evidence, dragged bodies, or left-behind trophies

---

## 4. NPC Positioning

Where you find NPCs (living or dead) tells their story.

### Living NPC Placement

| Position | Narrative Signal |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Guarding a door** | Something important is behind it |
| **Huddled in a corner** | Fear, injury, hiding from something |
| **Standing at a window** | Watching for something, longing, or keeping watch |
| **Pacing** | Anxiety, indecision, waiting for news |
| **Working at a station** | Normalcy, routine, or denial of surrounding danger |
| **Arguing with another NPC** | Conflict, disagreement about how to handle a situation |
| **Praying at a shrine** | Desperation, devotion, or seeking guidance |

### Dead NPC Placement

| Position | Narrative Signal |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Reaching toward a door** | Tried to escape but failed |
| **Protecting another body** | Died defending someone (parent/child, lovers, comrades) |
| **Facing the threat** | Stood their ground, fought back |
| **Facing away from threat** | Fled, was struck from behind |
| **In a group** | Mass casualty event, overwhelmed together |
| **Isolated, hidden** | Tried to hide but was found |
| **Near a completed task** | Finished their mission before dying (sealed the door, sent the message) |

## 5. Ambient Audio

Sound creates atmosphere and conveys information about unseen elements of the environment.

### Audio Storytelling Layers

| Layer | Function | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Ambient bed** | Establishes location and mood | Wind through ruins, dripping water, distant thunder |
| **Incidental sounds** | Suggests activity or presence | Footsteps above, distant conversation, animal calls |
| **Reactive audio** | Responds to player proximity or actions | Music swells near important locations, creaking when player steps on weak floors |
| **Absence of sound** | Signals danger or wrongness | Forest goes silent before a predator encounter |
| **Layered history** | Multiple audio sources tell a complex story | Church bells over battle sounds over crying |

### Audio Placement Rules

1. **Sound sources should be identifiable** -- Players should be able to locate where a sound comes from
2. **Volume conveys distance** -- Louder means closer, guiding exploration
3. **Unique audio signatures for unique locations** -- Each landmark should have a distinct sound profile
4. **Silence is a tool** -- Use it deliberately before high-tension moments
5. **Diegetic vs. non-diegetic** -- Sounds that exist in the game world vs. soundtrack/UI sounds should be clearly distinguished

---

## 6. Lighting as Narrative

Light and shadow are among the most powerful storytelling tools in level design.

### Lighting Techniques

| Technique | Narrative Purpose | Example |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Spotlight** | Draws attention to a specific object or area | A shaft of light illuminating a key item |
| **Warm vs. cool** | Indicates safety vs. danger, life vs. death | Warm firelight in safe areas, cold blue in dangerous ones |
| **Flickering** | Instability, supernatural presence, failing systems | Torch that flickers near a ghost's haunt |
| **Directional light** | Guides the player along a path | Light filtering through a crack in the wall showing the way forward |
| **Shadow patterns** | Conceals threats or reveals hidden geometry | Shadows that form recognizable shapes (a monster's silhouette) |
| **Light sources as progression markers** | Player follows the light | Lit torches mark the critical path; unlit ones lead to secrets |
| **Dying light** | Time pressure or decay | Lanterns running out of oil as you go deeper |

### Lighting Transitions

Changes in lighting communicate zone transitions:

- **Bright to dark** -- Entering danger, going underground, approaching evil
- **Dark to bright** -- Escape, relief, reaching the surface, revelation
- **Natural to artificial** -- Entering a constructed/inhabited space
- **Steady to flickering** -- Instability, something wrong here
- **Colored shift** -- Entering a magically influenced area (corruption, blessing)

## 7. Discoverable Lore Objects

Physical objects that the player can inspect to learn deeper world-building.

### Lore Object Types

| Type | Format | Player Engagement |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Journals/diaries** | Multi-page text, personal voice | High (reveals character and events) |
| **Letters** | Short, addressed correspondence | Medium (reveals relationships) |
| **Official documents** | Formal text, orders, decrees | Medium (reveals political/military context) |
| **Inscriptions** | Brief text carved into surfaces | Low effort, high atmosphere |
| **Murals/paintings** | Visual storytelling, no text needed | Accessible to all players |
| **Audio logs** | Recorded voice (if setting allows) | High engagement, does not interrupt gameplay |
| **Environmental puzzles** | Lore revealed by solving a spatial challenge | Very high engagement |
| **Artifacts** | Inspectable 3D objects with examine text | Medium, rewards thorough exploration |

### Lore Placement Guidelines

1. **Never gate critical information behind lore objects** -- Main story must be understandable without them
2. **Place lore near related environments** -- A battle journal should be found near a battlefield
3. **Create lore chains** -- A series of notes from the same author found across a zone tells a developing story
4. **Reward exploration** -- The best lore should be in optional or hidden areas
5. **Keep entries short** -- 50-150 words for notes, 200-400 for journal entries
6. **Voice them if possible** -- Audio delivery lets the player keep moving
7. **Date or sequence them** -- Players should understand the chronological order
8. **Leave gaps** -- Not every question needs an answer; mystery engages imagination

### Lore Density Targets

| Zone Type | Lore Objects | Placement |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Tutorial | 2-3 | On critical path, teaches inspection mechanic |
| Standard dungeon | 5-8 | Mix of critical path and hidden locations |
| Story-critical zone | 8-12 | Heavy placement, major revelations in hidden spots |
| Open world region | 10-20 | Spread across points of interest |
| Boss arena | 1-2 | Pre-boss area, contextualizes the fight |
