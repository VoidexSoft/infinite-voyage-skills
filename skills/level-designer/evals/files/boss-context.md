# Boss Context: Admiral Voss — The Shattered Tyrant

## Narrative Role

Admiral Voss is the corrupted commander of the UEC Leviathan, a capital-class dreadnought that has been consumed by Void energy. Once a decorated war hero, Voss fused with the ship's AI core during the Void incursion at Helix Station, becoming a half-machine hybrid who controls the dreadnought as an extension of his body. He serves as the Act 2 climax boss, representing the player's first encounter with a fully Void-corrupted authority figure.

The player boards the Leviathan to recover the Beacon Cipher — a decryption key needed to locate the Starweaver Array in Act 3. Voss guards the cipher in the ship's bridge, which doubles as the boss arena.

## Player Level Range

- **Recommended level:** 28-32
- **Gear expectation:** Full Rare set with at least 1 Epic weapon; players should have unlocked their subclass specialization by this point
- **Party size:** Solo (Infinite Voyage is a single-player RPG)

## Available Player Abilities (by Level 30)

### Core Combat
- **Plasma Blade** — Melee combo (3-hit chain), 45/55/80 damage per strike
- **Kinetic Burst** — Ranged AoE, 120 damage, 8 sec cooldown
- **Phase Dash** — Invulnerable dash, 0.4 sec i-frames, 3 sec cooldown
- **Shield Capacitor** — Absorbs 200 damage, 15 sec cooldown, 4 sec duration

### Subclass (Vanguard example)
- **Gravity Anchor** — Roots enemies in place for 3 sec, 20 sec cooldown
- **Overcharge Strike** — Single massive hit, 350 damage, 30 sec cooldown
- **Reactive Plating** — Passive: 15% damage reduction when below 40% HP

### Consumables (expected)
- Nano-repair kits (heal 40% HP over 5 sec), players carry 3-5
- EMP charges (stun mechanical enemies for 2 sec), players carry 1-2
- Void resistance stims (+30% Void resistance for 30 sec), players carry 1-2

## Arena: The Bridge of the UEC Leviathan

A circular command bridge roughly 40m in diameter with a raised central command platform (the AI core). The outer ring has 4 console stations that serve as destructible cover. The floor panels in the outer ring can electrify (arena hazard, controlled by Voss). Two emergency bulkhead doors on opposite sides can be sealed by Voss to restrict movement, or opened by the player by hacking adjacent terminals (3 sec channel, interruptible).

### Environmental Elements
- **AI Core (center):** Voss is tethered to this. During certain phases, damaging the core forces Voss into a vulnerable state
- **Console stations (x4):** Destructible cover; Voss destroys one per phase transition
- **Electrified floor panels:** Activate in patterns; deal 60 damage/sec; visual tell is blue sparking 1.5 sec before activation
- **Bulkhead doors (x2):** Voss seals these to cut off escape routes; player can hack terminals to reopen

## Design Constraints
- Fight duration target: 8-12 minutes
- No adds/minions in Phase 1; minion waves introduced in Phase 2
- Must have at least one mechanic that rewards using the EMP consumable
- Phase transitions should have clear cinematographic moments (brief camera shifts, not full cutscenes)
- The fight should teach the player about Void corruption mechanics needed for Act 3
