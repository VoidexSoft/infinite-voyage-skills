# Level Walkthrough Timing: Orbital Prison Kappa-9

## Context

Orbital Prison Kappa-9 is a decommissioned penal station orbiting a brown dwarf. The player infiltrates the station to rescue an NPC ally (Dr. Yara Kessler) who is being held in the maximum-security wing. The level has a stealth-optional approach — players can fight through or use ventilation shafts and hacking to bypass encounters.

**Level range:** 25-28
**Design intent:** Mid-game infiltration level with escalating tension toward a timed escape sequence

## Encounter Walkthrough

| # | Encounter Name | Type | Est. Clear Time | Tension | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Docking Clamp Override | Puzzle | 3 min | 3/10 | Hack the docking clamp to board. Tutorial for hacking minigame used throughout level. |
| 2 | Cell Block A — Guard Patrol | Combat/Stealth | 5 min | 5/10 | 4 guards on patrol. Stealth route available through ceiling vents. First real combat or stealth choice. |
| 3 | Warden's Log Terminal | Exploration | 2 min | 2/10 | Lore pickup. Audio log reveals Dr. Kessler's location and hints at what went wrong on the station. |
| 4 | Mess Hall Brawl | Combat | 6 min | 7/10 | 8 rogue prisoners + 2 guard bots caught in a three-way fight. Player can let them fight each other before engaging survivors. Explosive kitchen equipment. |
| 5 | Medical Bay Resupply | Exploration | 3 min | 1/10 | Safe room. Heal station, ammo cache, save point. A medical terminal provides optional backstory on Void experiments conducted on prisoners. |
| 6 | Ventilation Shaft Crawl | Traversal | 4 min | 4/10 | Navigation puzzle through a vent system. Steam vents deal damage on a timer. Leads to either Cell Block B (stealth approach) or Armory (combat approach). |
| 7 | Cell Block B — Void-Touched Inmates | Combat | 7 min | 8/10 | 6 Void-corrupted prisoners with unpredictable attack patterns. One inmate is a mini-boss (Void Brute) with charge attack and ground slam. Tight corridors limit dodge options. |
| 8 | Security Control Room | Puzzle | 4 min | 5/10 | Three-terminal hacking puzzle to disable security lockdown on the max-sec wing. Timer element — failing a terminal triggers a 60-second alarm with respawning drones. |
| 9 | Corridor to Max-Sec | Traversal | 2 min | 6/10 | Walking stretch. Atmospheric tension — flickering lights, distant screams, Void tendrils growing on walls. No enemies but the environment communicates escalating danger. |
| 10 | Max-Sec Wing — Warden Zhara | Boss | 10 min | 9/10 | Warden Zhara is a cybernetically enhanced human who controls prison defense turrets. Two-phase fight: Phase 1 — dodge turret patterns and damage Zhara directly; Phase 2 — Zhara activates Void mode, turrets become mobile drones, arena shrinks with Void corruption spreading from edges. |
| 11 | Dr. Kessler Rescue Cutscene | Narrative | 2 min | 3/10 | Brief narrative beat. Dr. Kessler is freed, reveals critical intel about the Void source, and triggers the escape sequence. |
| 12 | Station Self-Destruct Escape | Timed Chase | 5 min | 10/10 | 3-minute countdown to reach the docking bay. Collapsing corridors, exploding bulkheads, one final combat gauntlet (4 security bots) blocking the exit. Failure = restart from encounter 11. |
| 13 | Docking Bay Departure | Narrative/Traversal | 2 min | 2/10 | Player reaches the ship. Final cinematic of the station exploding. Level complete. XP and loot rewards distributed. |

## Known Concerns

- Encounters 2 and 3 are both low-tension. Is there a dead zone risk between encounters 1-4?
- The jump from encounter 5 (tension 1) to encounter 7 (tension 8) is steep — encounter 6 at tension 4 may not be sufficient bridging.
- Encounters 9 and 11 are both non-combat, low-duration — are they too close together?
- The timed escape (encounter 12) immediately after the boss (encounter 10) with only a brief cutscene (encounter 11) in between — does the player get enough recovery time?
- No checkpoint between encounter 7 and encounter 10. Is that a 21-minute stretch without a save opportunity?
