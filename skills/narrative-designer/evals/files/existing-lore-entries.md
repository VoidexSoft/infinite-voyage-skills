# Existing Codex Entries — Consistency Check Reference

## Entry 1: Codex — "Drift-Crystal"

**Category:** Science
**Discovery trigger:** Player purchases first star chart from Zara

---

Drift-crystal is a naturally occurring mineral found exclusively in the debris
fields surrounding Void Tide zones. When subjected to a calibrated electrical
charge, drift-crystal produces a stable resonance field that allows ship
navigation systems to lock onto FTL drift-lanes. Without it, drift-jumps are
effectively blind — possible, but with a catastrophic margin of error.

The Meridian Compact controls the largest known drift-crystal refineries,
processing raw crystal hauled from the edge of Void Tide zones by contracted
salvage crews. Refined drift-crystal degrades over approximately eighteen
standard months, ensuring a constant demand cycle. Attempts to synthesize
drift-crystal in laboratory settings have universally failed; the mineral
appears to require proximity to Void Tide phenomena during its formation.

The Ashen Choir claims that drift-crystal is not a mineral at all, but a
"residue" — a physical byproduct of whatever process generates the Void Tides
themselves. Most scientists dismiss this as mysticism.

**Hidden connection:** If drift-crystal is Void Tide residue, controlling the
Tides means controlling the supply.

## Entry 2: Codex — "The Armistice of Drifthall"

**Category:** History
**Discovery trigger:** Complete quest "Echoes of the Contact War"

---

The Armistice of Drifthall, signed in 2216 CE, ended the fourteen-month
conflict between humanity and the Khet-Orin. The terms were surprisingly simple:
the Khet-Orin would withdraw all presence beyond the Pale Reach, and humanity
would not pursue. No reparations, no territorial exchanges, no ongoing
diplomatic framework.

Captain Asha Voss — then a junior officer — was among the human delegation and
later described the Khet-Orin as "eager to leave, not eager for peace." The
distinction troubled her for years. The Khet-Orin representative, whose name
was recorded only as a harmonic tone designation, spoke a single translated
sentence during the signing: "You are not what we came to find."

No Khet-Orin vessel has been confirmed in human space since the Armistice,
though unverified sightings are reported near Void Tide zones every few years.

**Hidden connection:** "You are not what we came to find" — what WERE they
looking for?

## Entry 3: Codex — "Spacer-Born"

**Category:** Culture
**Discovery trigger:** First conversation with any spacer-born NPC

---

"Spacer-born" refers to humans born and raised aboard ships or stations rather
than on planetary surfaces. Roughly 12% of the Traverse's human population is
spacer-born, though the number is growing as permanent settlements become less
viable in unstable regions.

Spacer-born communities develop distinct cultural markers: an intuitive
understanding of zero-gravity movement, a communal approach to resources, and a
deep superstition about "the quiet" — any unexplained silence in a ship's
ambient noise. Many spacer-born never set foot on a planet and describe
planetary gravity as "oppressive" or "wrong."

Zara Okoye, the star cartographer on Meridian Station, is spacer-born and
occasionally references the cultural norms of convoy life when speaking with the
player.

---

**Hidden connection:** Spacer-born sensitivity to "the quiet" may relate to
Void Tide proximity effects.

## DRAFT Entry — For Consistency Review

## Entry 4 (DRAFT): Codex — "The Pale Reach"

**Category:** Geography
**Discovery trigger:** Player first views the Pale Reach on a star chart

---

The Pale Reach is the vast, sparsely charted region beyond the Traverse's
established trade routes. It earned its name from the characteristic dim,
blue-shifted light of its few scattered stars. The Reach is formally claimed by
no faction, though the Meridian Compact maintains two refueling outposts along
its border.

Before the Contact War, the Pale Reach was considered a promising frontier for
expansion. The Khet-Orin were first encountered here in 2214, and after the
Armistice of Drifthall, the region was effectively abandoned. The Ashen Choir
launched three expeditions into the deep Reach between 2220 and 2228; only two
returned. The third, led by Dr. Ilyena Dross herself, vanished in 2227.

Void Tide activity in the Pale Reach is estimated to be four to six times more
frequent than in the core Traverse. Whether this is a natural property of the
region or a consequence of Khet-Orin activity remains unknown.

---

**Hidden connection:** The Pale Reach may be the origin point of the Void Tides
themselves.
