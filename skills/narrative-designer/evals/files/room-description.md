# Location Descriptions — Environmental Storytelling Targets

## Location 1: Abandoned Drift-Jump Calibration Lab (Aethon Station Wreckage)

**Setting:** A small, sealed laboratory aboard what remains of Aethon research
station. The station was found adrift after the Sundering — structurally intact,
but with no crew aboard. This lab was used for drift-crystal calibration, a
process essential for FTL navigation.

**Spatial layout:**
- Rectangular room, approx 6m x 4m
- Central workbench with mounted calibration equipment
- Wall-mounted storage lockers (some open, some sealed)
- A single viewport looking out into dead space
- Emergency exit hatch on the far wall (manually sealed from the inside)
- Floor-level ventilation grates
- Ceiling-mounted emergency lighting (flickering, low power)

**Current state:** The room has power but no life support cycling. Dust on every
surface. Equipment is intact — not destroyed, not packed up. It looks like
everyone simply stopped and left. There are personal effects scattered around:
a mug on the workbench, a jacket draped over a chair, a datapad face-down on
the floor.

**Player context:** The player is exploring Aethon station for the first time.
They do not yet know what happened to the crew.

## Location 2: Zara's Star Chart Workshop (Meridian Station)

**Setting:** A cluttered workshop on Meridian Station's lower decks, rented by
Zara the Star Cartographer. Zara uses this space to compile, cross-reference,
and sell navigational charts. She is a recurring NPC the player has met before.

**Spatial layout:**
- Irregularly shaped room tucked into a corridor junction
- Walls covered in pinned star charts, hand-annotated overlays, and string
  connecting points of interest
- A large holographic projector in the center (currently off)
- A cot in the corner with rumpled blankets
- Shelves overflowing with data-cores, old navigational instruments, and books
- A locked cabinet near the door
- Two chairs, one on each side of a small desk covered in notes

**Current state:** The room is messy but lived-in. Zara clearly spends most of
her time here. There are signs of recent, intense work — multiple charts are
layered on the projector platform, empty stimulant drink cans are stacked on the
desk, and the cot looks slept-in. A section of wall charts has been circled in
red marker with the note "DOES NOT MATCH" written beside it.

**Player context:** The player is visiting Zara for a routine chart purchase but
she is not in the workshop. They can look around freely.
