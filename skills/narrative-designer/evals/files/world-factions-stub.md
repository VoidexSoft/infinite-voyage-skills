# Existing Factions of the Infinite Voyage

## 1. The Meridian Compact

**Type:** Interstellar trade federation
**Headquarters:** Meridian Station, orbiting the gas giant Tycho-9
**Philosophy:** "Commerce is the truest form of diplomacy."

The Meridian Compact controls roughly 40% of all licensed trade routes in the
Traverse. They operate massive convoy fleets protected by privateer escorts and
maintain a network of refueling depots across three star systems. Their power
comes from controlling the only reliable supply of refined drift-crystal, which
is essential for long-range FTL calibration.

**Known traits:** Pragmatic, transactional, will deal with anyone who pays.
Players can trade freely at Compact stations but face steep tariffs.

## 2. The Ashen Choir

**Type:** Quasi-religious scientific order
**Headquarters:** The Reliquary (a converted colony ship adrift in the Pale Reach)
**Philosophy:** "The Void speaks. We listen."

The Ashen Choir believes the Void Tides are not a natural phenomenon but a form
of communication from an intelligence older than the known universe. They send
expeditions into Void Tide zones that no other faction will enter, and many of
their members bear physical scars from exposure — silver-white streaks across
their skin they call "scripture marks." They hoard navigational data and ancient
artifacts, rarely sharing findings with outsiders.

**Known traits:** Secretive, fanatical but knowledgeable. Players who earn their
trust gain access to unique star charts and Void Tide research.

## 3. The Free Drift Collective

**Type:** Loose alliance of independent pilots, salvagers, and frontier settlers
**Headquarters:** None (distributed across dozens of small outposts)
**Philosophy:** "No flags. No borders. Just sky."

The Collective is less a faction and more a mutual-aid network for those who
refuse to align with the larger powers. They share fuel caches, trade intel
about hazards, and occasionally band together to repel pirates or corporate
claim-jumpers. Their strength is their unpredictability — no central leadership
means no single point of failure, but it also means no coordination in a crisis.

**Known traits:** Fiercely independent, suspicious of authority. Players who help
Collective outposts earn safe harbor and black-market access.
