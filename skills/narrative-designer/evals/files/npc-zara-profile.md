- **Role:** Independent star cartographer and navigational data broker
- **Species/Origin:** Human; born on a Meridian Compact convoy freighter (spacer-born)

- **Want:** To map the Void Tides and prove they follow a pattern
- **Need:** To accept that some things cannot be charted or controlled
- **Fear:** That the universe is truly random and her work is meaningless

## Voice
- **Speech pattern:** Quick, enthusiastic, talks with her hands; shifts to terse and precise when stressed
- **Vocabulary:** Technical but accessible; uses cartography metaphors for everything

- **Example lines:**
  - Happy: "Look at this — you see how the drift lines converge here? That's not noise, that's a signal."
  - Angry: "Don't touch that chart. Don't even breathe on that chart."
  - Afraid: "The numbers moved again. I plotted this route yesterday and now it goes somewhere else."
