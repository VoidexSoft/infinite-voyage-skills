## Key Events — Detail Notes

### The Quiet Year (2203-2204)
The Outer Reach — a frontier region of six colony outposts — went completely
silent for eleven months. No distress signals, no data transmissions, nothing.
When contact resumed, the survivors described spatial distortions: stars in
different positions, familiar routes leading to unknown space. Official reports
blamed a "cascade failure in relay infrastructure." Unofficial accounts suggest
something far stranger. Several survivors later joined the Ashen Choir.

### The Sundering (2231)
The largest Void Tide event on record. Three colonies — Harken's Rest, Port
Sable, and the research station Aethon — were destroyed or displaced. Aethon
was never found. Harken's Rest was discovered 0.7 light-years from its original
position, intact but empty. Port Sable survived with heavy casualties. The
Sundering is the reason most factions now avoid Void Tide zones entirely. The
Ashen Choir considers it a "revelation event."

## Unresolved Lore Threads (Internal)
- What actually happened during the Quiet Year?
- Is there a connection between the Quiet Year and the Sundering?
- What happened to the crew of Aethon station?
- Are the Khet-Orin aware of the Void Tides? Did they withdraw because of them?
- Dr. Ilyena Dross disappeared in 2229. Where is she?

## Tone & Vocabulary
- Space is vast, lonely, and beautiful — never safe
- Technology is reliable but not miraculous; things break
- The unknown is treated with awe, not horror
- Use nautical terminology for space travel (drift, berth, helm, harbor)
- Avoid military jargon unless referring to the Contact War specifically
