# World Timeline

The chronological history of the game universe. This document serves as the authoritative reference for all historical events, ensuring consistency across quests, codex entries, dialogue, and environmental storytelling. Every piece of narrative content that references a date, an era, or a historical event must align with this timeline.

## Timeline Structure

The timeline is divided into **Eras**, each defined by a transformative event. Within each era, events are listed chronologically. Each event entry follows this format:

```markdown
### [Year] -- [Event Name]

**Impact:** [Brief description of what changed]
**Regions Affected:** [Which gameplay regions this event shaped]
**Content Connections:** [Quests, codex entries, characters, or locations that reference this event]
**Evidence in World:** [How players encounter traces of this event during gameplay]
```

### Era Classification

| Era | Date Range | Defining Characteristic |
|-----|-----------|------------------------|
| **The Old Earth Era** | Pre-2400 | Humanity confined to the Sol system |
| **The Expansion Era** | 2400-2650 | Discovery of warp corridors, rapid colonization |
| **The Fracture Era** | 2650-2790 | Colonial wars, political fragmentation |

| **The Remnant Era** | 2840-Present (2847) | Discovery of alien ruins, the game's present day |

---

## The Old Earth Era (Pre-2400)

This era is distant history to the characters in the game. It is referenced in codex entries and by characters with academic interests but is not directly relevant to gameplay. It provides cultural context.

### Pre-2400 -- Humanity's Cradle

**Impact:** Humanity develops spaceflight, colonizes the Sol system, builds orbital habitats. Slower-than-light travel limits expansion to nearby stars. A few generation ships are launched toward promising systems; their fates are unknown.

**Regions Affected:** None directly (pre-dates all gameplay regions)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "Old Earth Histories" (academic compilation)
- Characters who collect Old Earth artifacts or use Earth idioms as affectations

**Evidence in World:** Antique items, cultural references, a handful of Old Earth relics in museum collections on Core System stations.

---

## The Expansion Era (2400-2650)

The discovery of warp corridors transformed humanity from a single-system species into a galactic presence. This era is the "age of heroes" in popular culture -- romanticized, mythologized, and poorly documented.

### 2403 -- Discovery of the First Warp Corridor

**Impact:** Dr. Amara Vasquez's research vessel *Pathfinder* detects an anomalous gravitational signature near Neptune's orbit. Investigation reveals a stable wormhole -- the first warp corridor. It connects Sol to the Kepler Sector, 400 light-years away. Humanity's expansion begins.

**Regions Affected:** Core Systems (the first colonies on the other side of the corridor)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "The Vasquez Breakthrough"
- Waypoint Station Cygnus has a Vasquez memorial plaque
- Old navigation equipment styled after *Pathfinder*-era tech appears as collectibles

**Evidence in World:** The "Vasquez Corridor" is still the primary warp route between Sol and Kepler. Players use it during the tutorial.

### 2410-2500 -- The Colony Rush

**Impact:** Dozens of warp corridors are mapped across the Kepler Sector. Colonies spring up on habitable worlds and stations are built at corridor junctions. Corporate interests, national governments, and independent groups all stake claims. The period is chaotic, opportunistic, and largely unregulated.

**Regions Affected:** Core Systems, early Frontier Systems

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "The Colony Rush" (cultural history)
- Several Frontier stations bear names from this period (named after colony ships or founding families)
- NPCs from old colonial families reference this era with pride or resentment depending on how their ancestors fared

**Evidence in World:** Architectural layers -- older stations have Colony Rush-era construction (riveted steel, exposed conduits) beneath modern refits. Level designers should distinguish these layers visually.

### 2520 -- The Kepler Sector Census

**Impact:** The first comprehensive survey of the Kepler Sector counts 47 inhabited systems, 200+ stations, and approximately 3 billion humans living outside Sol. The scale of expansion becomes undeniable. Governance is fragmented across hundreds of independent authorities.

**Regions Affected:** All inhabited regions

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "The Census of 2520" (statistical history)
- Political NPCs reference the census as the moment it became clear that centralized governance was needed (or, depending on faction, the moment freedom was at its peak)

**Evidence in World:** Census data terminals in government buildings display population figures and system claims from this period.

### 2580 -- First Contact with the Deep Reach

**Impact:** Explorer vessels push beyond the mapped corridor network into uncharted space. The Deep Reach is named -- a vast region of star systems with no known warp corridors connecting them. Travel there requires long sub-light jumps between corridor endpoints. The systems are resource-rich but hostile.

**Regions Affected:** Deep Reach (establishes the region)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "Into the Deep Reach" (exploration history)
- quest_deep_reach_mapping references this era's original survey data
- Frontier characters tell stories of Deep Reach pioneers

**Evidence in World:** Deep Reach systems have minimal infrastructure -- whatever was built in this era has been patched and re-patched for centuries. Environmental storytelling shows layers of human habitation over alien terrain.

---

## The Fracture Era (2650-2790)

Rapid expansion without governance led to conflict. The Fracture Era is the Kepler Sector's dark age -- a period of resource wars, piracy, and political collapse. It ended only when exhaustion and necessity drove the surviving factions to negotiate.

### 2651 -- The Corridor Wars Begin

**Impact:** Three major colonial blocs -- the Meridian Alliance, the Outer Ring Compact, and the Free Systems Coalition -- go to war over control of warp corridor junctions. Controlling a junction means controlling trade, communication, and military movement. The wars last, in various forms, for over a century.

**Regions Affected:** Core Systems (primary battleground), Frontier Systems (supply lines and refugee flows)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "The Corridor Wars" (multi-part historical series)
- Older NPCs in the Frontier have family histories shaped by the wars
- Derelict warships from this era are explorable wrecks in several systems
- Faction tensions in the present trace back to Corridor War allegiances

**Evidence in World:** Battle scars on stations. Memorial walls. Weapon designs from this era found as artifacts. Navigation hazards from old minefields.

### 2710 -- The Meridian Massacre

**Impact:** The Outer Ring Compact destroys Meridian Station's civilian quarter during a siege, killing 40,000 non-combatants. The event is the Fracture Era's most infamous atrocity. It galvanizes neutral systems against the Compact and becomes the moral rallying point for eventual peace negotiations.

**Regions Affected:** Core Systems (Meridian Station)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "The Meridian Massacre" (historical account with multiple perspectives)
- Zara Osei was born on the rebuilt Meridian Station -- the massacre is part of her cultural heritage
- Director Voss references the massacre when arguing for Concord Authority control: "Never again"
- A memorial quest allows the player to visit the preserved ruins of the civilian quarter

**Evidence in World:** Meridian Station has a visible architectural divide between the rebuilt section (modern) and the preserved ruins (memorial). Environmental storytelling in the ruins is wordless and devastating.

### 2788 -- The Exhaustion Accords

**Impact:** After 137 years of intermittent war, the major factions sign a ceasefire. Not a peace treaty -- a mutual acknowledgment that no one can win. The Accords establish neutral zones, trade corridors, and a framework for negotiation. They set the stage for the Concord.

**Regions Affected:** All inhabited regions

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "The Exhaustion Accords" (political history)
- Diplomatic NPCs reference the Accords as both triumph and compromise
- The Accords' legal language is still cited in present-day trade disputes

**Evidence in World:** Neutral zone markers at corridor junctions date from this period. Some bear graffiti from soldiers on both sides.

---

## The Concord Era (2790-2840)

A period of rebuilding, centralization, and cautious optimism. The Concord Authority emerges as the Kepler Sector's governing body. Not everyone is happy about it.

### 2801 -- The Callisto Accord and the Founding of the Concord Authority

**Impact:** Building on the Exhaustion Accords, delegates from all major factions meet on Callisto Station to establish a permanent governing body. The Concord Authority is founded with a mandate to maintain peace, regulate warp corridors, and coordinate resource distribution. It is a compromise -- the Authority has real power but limited jurisdiction. Frontier systems retain significant autonomy.

**Regions Affected:** Core Systems (directly governed), Frontier Systems (loosely affiliated), Deep Reach (nominally claimed, practically ungoverned)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "The Callisto Accord" (foundational political document)
- Director Voss serves the Authority and embodies its philosophy
- Frontier NPCs view the Authority with suspicion ("They promise safety. They deliver control.")
- Hidden objective in quest_silent_observatory: the observatory's activation timestamp matches 2801 -- implying the Remnant responded to the Concord's founding

**Evidence in World:** Concord Authority insignia on government buildings, patrol vessels, and official documents. The insignia is a stylized warp corridor with a star at its center.

### 2810-2835 -- The Reconstruction

**Impact:** Twenty-five years of rebuilding. War-damaged stations are repaired. Trade routes stabilize. Population grows. The Concord Authority establishes the Voyager program -- licensed explorers tasked with surveying unclaimed systems and assessing Frontier regions for safe colonization. The player's role originates here.

**Regions Affected:** All regions (rebuilding is sector-wide)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "The Reconstruction" (cultural history)
- The Voyager license the player carries was established in this period
- Older Voyagers the player meets were among the first licensed; they have stories

**Evidence in World:** Construction equipment and half-finished expansions on stations. "Reconstruction Era" architecture is clean, modular, optimistic -- in contrast to both the riveted Colony Rush style and the brutalist Fracture Era fortifications.

---

## The Remnant Era (2840-Present)

The current era. The discovery of alien ruins has upended the Kepler Sector's politics, science, and sense of place in the universe. The game takes place in 2847, seven years into this era.

### 2840 -- First Remnant Discovery

**Impact:** Survey Team Epsilon, operating in the Deep Reach, discovers an artificial structure orbiting a dead star. It is clearly not human. Carbon dating estimates its age at over 500,000 years. The structure is a sensor array of unknown purpose. Humanity is not alone in the universe -- or at least, it was not always alone.

**Regions Affected:** Deep Reach (discovery site), all regions (cultural and political shockwave)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "First Contact" (misnomer -- the Remnant are long gone, but the name stuck)
- Zara Osei's career pivot hinges on this discovery
- The first Remnant site is visitable as a historical landmark in-game
- Every faction's current agenda is shaped by their response to this discovery

**Evidence in World:** The original Remnant site is preserved as a research station. The player can visit it. It is smaller and less impressive than later discoveries -- a reminder that understanding came in stages.

### 2841 -- The Classification Debate

**Impact:** The Concord Authority moves to classify all Remnant findings under security protocols. The scientific community erupts in protest. Frontier systems refuse to comply, arguing that Remnant sites in their territory are their property. The debate is never fully resolved -- the Authority controls information in Core Systems but cannot enforce classification in the Frontier or Deep Reach.

**Regions Affected:** Core Systems (classification enforced), Frontier Systems (classification resisted), Deep Reach (unenforceable)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "The Classification Debate" (political history, multiple perspectives)
- Zara resigned from the Authority over this policy
- Director Voss defends classification as necessary for public safety
- Frontier faction questlines involve smuggling Remnant data past Authority checkpoints

**Evidence in World:** Classified data terminals (locked, requiring Authority clearance). Underground data markets. Research stations operating in legal gray zones.

### 2843 -- Remnant Sites Proliferate

**Impact:** As more Voyagers reach the Deep Reach, Remnant sites are found in dozens of systems. The ruins are varied -- observatories, data repositories, structures of unknown function. A pattern emerges: all sites appear oriented toward the same region of space, later identified as The Silence. The Remnant were watching something.

**Regions Affected:** Deep Reach (primary), Frontier Systems (secondary sites found)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "Catalog of Remnant Sites" (growing database)
- Multiple quest hooks originate from newly discovered sites
- The pattern of orientation toward The Silence is a key revelation in the main quest

**Evidence in World:** Remnant sites as explorable locations throughout the Deep Reach. Each site has unique characteristics but shares common architectural elements -- crystalline structures, impossible geometry, materials that do not corrode.

### 2845 -- The Silence Is Named

**Impact:** Astronomer collective identifies the region of space that all Remnant sites are oriented toward. It is a vast area where no signals -- natural or artificial -- have ever been detected. No stars are visible within it, though stellar models predict they should be there. The region is named The Silence. Attempts to send probes into it fail -- probes either return no data or do not return at all.

**Regions Affected:** The Silence (established as a region), Deep Reach (proximity)

**Content Connections:**
- Codex: "The Silence" (scientific and speculative accounts)
- Zara's brother Kofi was lost near The Silence's boundary
- The main quest arc moves toward The Silence as its ultimate destination
- Ambient dialogue across all regions references The Silence with unease

**Evidence in World:** Star maps show The Silence as a blank region. NPCs in observatories and navigation posts point toward it. Ships near its boundary experience sensor anomalies.

### 2847 -- The Game Begins

**Impact:** The player, a newly licensed Voyager, arrives at Waypoint Station Cygnus. Remnant observatories in the Deep Reach have begun activating after millennia of dormancy. The constellations are shifting. Something is happening in The Silence. The Concord Authority is worried. The Frontier is opportunistic. The scientific community is divided between excitement and dread. This is where the player's story starts.

**Regions Affected:** All regions

**Content Connections:**
- quest_first_voyage (tutorial)
- quest_silent_observatory (inciting incident)
- All main quest content

**Evidence in World:** Everything the player experiences. The game IS this moment.

## Timeline and Gameplay Regions

Each gameplay region has a historical character shaped by when and how it was settled. This affects architecture, NPC attitudes, available lore, and environmental storytelling.

### Core Systems

**Historical Character:** Old money, old power. These systems were the first colonized and bear the deepest layers of history. Architecture ranges from Colony Rush-era industrial to sleek Concord Era administrative buildings. The Corridor Wars left scars that reconstruction has mostly covered. Authority presence is strong. People here think in terms of institutions and precedent.

**Timeline Layers Visible:** Colony Rush (oldest infrastructure), Fracture Era (fortifications, memorials), Concord Era (government buildings, reconstruction).

### Frontier Systems

**Historical Character:** Independence, pragmatism, distrust. The Frontier was settled by people escaping the Corridor Wars or seeking opportunity beyond Authority control. Architecture is patchwork -- whatever works, built from whatever is available. History here is personal, not institutional. NPCs reference family stories, not political events.

**Timeline Layers Visible:** Colony Rush (founding structures), Fracture Era (improvised fortifications, refugee camp remnants), Reconstruction (partial modernization, Authority outposts built over local objections).

### Deep Reach

**Historical Character:** The unknown made tangible. Human presence here is thin and recent. Whatever infrastructure exists is functional and temporary-feeling. The dominant historical presence is the Remnant -- their structures dwarf anything humans have built. History here is not human history; it is the history of something older and incomprehensible.

**Timeline Layers Visible:** Expansion Era (earliest survey markers), Remnant Era (research stations, survey camps), Remnant (structures predating human civilization by hundreds of thousands of years).

### The Silence

**Historical Character:** Absence. No human structure has been successfully built here. No Remnant ruin has been found inside its boundaries. It is defined by what is not there. Any content set in or near The Silence should feel like the edge of the known world.

**Timeline Layers Visible:** None. That is the point.

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Events

When adding a historical event to the timeline:

1. Verify it does not contradict existing events
2. Assign it to the correct era
3. Fill in all template fields (Impact, Regions Affected, Content Connections, Evidence in World)
4. Update the Timeline-to-Content Mapping table
5. Notify all writers working on affected quests, characters, or codex entries
6. Run the consistency check: `scripts/consistency_check.py --timeline`

### Modifying Existing Events

Changing an established event requires:

1. Documenting the change and the reason in the timeline's version history
2. Identifying all content that references the changed event (use the mapping table)
3. Updating all affected content for consistency
4. Review by the narrative lead before committing

### Version History
