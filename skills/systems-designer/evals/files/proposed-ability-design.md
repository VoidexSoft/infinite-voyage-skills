# Proposed Ability Design: Stellar Overdrive System

## Context
This design was drafted by a junior designer for a new "Overdrive" combat system in Infinite Voyage. It needs review by the systems designer before moving to implementation. The intent is to give players a powerful super-state they can activate during combat.

## Stellar Overdrive — Draft Design

### Overview
When the player fills their Overdrive Gauge to 100%, they can activate Stellar Overdrive, which makes them massively more powerful for 30 seconds. During Overdrive:
- All damage is increased by 300%
- Player takes 0 damage (full invincibility)
- All ability cooldowns are reset and reduced to 0 for the duration
- Movement speed increased by 100%
- All enemies within 20m are stunned for 3 seconds on activation

### Gauge Mechanics
- Overdrive Gauge fills by dealing damage (1% per 50 damage dealt)
- Gauge fills by taking damage (2% per hit received regardless of damage amount)
- Gauge never decays or drains
- Gauge carries between combat encounters
- Gauge carries between play sessions (persistent)

### Upgrades
Players can invest skill points into the Overdrive skill tree:
- **Level 1:** Overdrive duration +10s (total 40s)
- **Level 2:** Overdrive damage bonus +100% (total 400%)
- **Level 3:** Overdrive heals player to full HP on activation
- **Level 4:** Overdrive Gauge fills 50% faster
- **Level 5:** Overdrive can be activated at 50% gauge (half duration)
- **Level 6:** Overdrive duration +10s (total 50s at max)
- **Level 7:** Overdrive persists through death (respawn in Overdrive state)

### Multiplayer Behavior
- In co-op, each player has their own Overdrive Gauge
- Overdrive bonuses stack with party buffs
- No interaction with ally abilities during Overdrive
- In PvP, Overdrive works identically (full invincibility, 300%+ damage)

### Boss Design Impact
- Bosses should be designed with "Overdrive DPS windows" in mind
- Boss health pools will be tuned assuming 1-2 Overdrive activations per fight
- Recommended: Add boss phases that are "only beatable during Overdrive"

### Economy
- Overdrive Booster consumable: instantly fills gauge to 100% (purchasable from cash shop for 500 Stellar Credits)
- Overdrive Extender consumable: doubles Overdrive duration (purchasable for 300 Stellar Credits)
- Stellar Credits can be earned in-game at a rate of ~50 per hour or purchased with real money

### Narrative
- No narrative justification provided yet
- "We can figure out the lore later"

## Designer Notes
"I think this will make players feel really powerful and excited. The invincibility window lets them go all-out without worrying about dying. The cash shop items give players who don't have time to grind a way to keep up."
