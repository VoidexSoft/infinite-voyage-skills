Do they have classes? Can they die permanently? Do they overlap with the 4-player co-op system?); documents constraints from current systems (4 ability slots limit how crew buffs manifest, stamina system already governs combat pacing, attribute system already has Resolve for social); and flags potential conflicts (crew combat bonuses could conflict with PvP normalization, crew loyalty rewards could create mandatory unfun if grinding relationship scores).
