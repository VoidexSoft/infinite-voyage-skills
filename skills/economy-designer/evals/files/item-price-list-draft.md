## Known Issues (For Reviewer)

- Pricing may not be internally consistent across tiers
- Some sell-to-buy ratios look off (check Photon Annihilator and Nebula Weave)
- Crafting material sell prices might allow arbitrage with vendor recipes
- Warp Fuel Cell sell price seems too high relative to buy price (45% return)
- Graviton Hammer seems underpriced for its tier
- Dark Matter Residue sell:buy ratio (70%) way above the ~30% standard
