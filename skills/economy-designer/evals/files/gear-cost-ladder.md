## Pacing Concerns

- Milestone 2 (11 hours) feels steep for early-game players who haven't committed yet
- Milestone 6 time-to-afford (29.4 hours) is nearly double Milestone 5 — is the jump too harsh?
- Endgame daily cap creates a 9-day minimum gate — is that player-friendly?
- No alternate progression paths listed (crafting, trading, faction rewards)
