## Current F2P Earning Analysis

A free player earning SD through gameplay only:
- Weekly: ~25 SD (challenges) + ~1.4 SD (daily login amortized) = ~26.4 SD/week
- Monthly: ~106 SD/month + season pass free track (~25 SD/month) = ~131 SD/month
- Cheapest cosmetic (Title): 150 SD -> **~5 weeks of free play**
- Ship Skin (Nebula Flame): 800 SD -> **~6 months of free play**

## Questions for Economy Review

1. Are Category C items pay-to-win or acceptable convenience?
2. Category D items are obviously problematic — but how do we draw the line?
3. Is the F2P earning rate fair? A title taking 5 weeks feels punishing.
4. Should the Credit Booster (+25% GC) be considered P2W since GC buys gear?
5. The Premium Track+ "20 level skip" — does this cross the line in seasonal content?
