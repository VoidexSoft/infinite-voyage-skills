## Lines Requiring Voice Spec

1. **Greeting (first visit)**
   "Well, well... a new face on Requiem Station. Don't get many of those since the Drift closed."
   *Context: Player enters shop for the first time. Zara is curious but guarded.*

2. **Greeting (returning customer)**
   "Back again? I knew you had taste. Or desperation. Either way, come look."
   *Context: Player has visited before. Zara is playful, teasing.*

3. **Selling pitch**
   "This coil survived the Cascade Event. Pre-war tech. You won't find another one this side of the Rift."
   *Context: Highlighting a rare item. Proud, persuasive, a little theatrical.*

4. **Haggling — player lowballs**
   "Oh, you wound me! My grandmother's ghost just shed a tear. That price is an insult to her memory."
   *Context: Player offered too little. Dramatic, mock-offended, but still playful.*

5. **Haggling — deal accepted**
   "Fine, fine. You drive a hard bargain, Navigator. Take it before I change my mind."
   *Context: Relenting with good humor. Resigned but friendly.*

6. **Lore drop — station history**
   "Requiem wasn't always a trading post. Before the Silence, this was a military listening station. You can still hear the old signals if you know where to tune."
   *Context: Sharing station lore during idle conversation. Wistful, nostalgic, slightly haunted.*

7. **Warning**
   "Listen close — the Voidborn have been spotted in Sector 7. If you're heading that way, pack extra cells. And say your goodbyes."
   *Context: Urgent warning before player leaves. Drops the playful act, deadly serious.*

8. **Reaction to rare item shown**
   "Where... where did you find this? Do you know what you're holding? This changes everything."
   *Context: Player shows a plot-critical artifact. Genuinely shocked, voice cracks with emotion.*

9. **Farewell (standard)**
   "Safe travels, Navigator. The void is cold, but the credits are warm."
   *Context: Standard shop exit line. Warm, habitual.*

10. **Farewell (after lore conversation)**
    "Remember what I told you about the signals. When you hear them... you'll understand."
    *Context: Cryptic farewell tied to lore thread. Mysterious, almost whispering.*

11. **Under attack (station raid event)**
    "Get behind the counter! No — grab that weapon! They're breaching the market level!"
    *Context: Station is under Voidborn attack. Panicked but taking charge. Adrenaline.*

12. **Injured dialogue**
    "I've... had worse. Patch me up and I'll owe you one. A big one."
    *Context: Zara is wounded during the raid. Trying to stay tough, voice strained with pain.*

## Production Notes
- Need 3 takes per line minimum
- Emotion tags must be embedded in filenames
- Session budget: ~2 hours studio time
- Lines may be expanded — this is the core set for vertical slice
- All lines must work with and without radio filter (some play over comms)
