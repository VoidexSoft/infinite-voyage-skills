5. Knowledge-gated progression (player learns, not character)

### Strengths
- Exceptional world design where every location teaches something
- The "aha moment" discovery loop is unmatched in the genre
- Minimal hand-holding encourages genuine exploration

- Short playtime (~15-20 hours) limits perceived value for some buyers

### Differentiators (vs. Infinite Voyage)
- Outer Wilds has no combat; Infinite Voyage includes tactical combat

  progression and branching narrative

  equipment/ability gating

### Lessons Learned

  creating shareable "aha" moments
- A curated, hand-crafted world beats procedural generation for mystery games
- Price point of $24.99 works for 15-20 hour exploration games; Infinite
  Voyage's 50+ hours justifies $29.99-$39.99

## 6. Comparable #5: Outer Wilds + Echoes of the Eye (DLC)

Note: This entry focuses specifically on the DLC to analyze expansion
potential and audience retention for a discovery-based game.

### Basic Info
- **Developer:** Mobius Digital
- **Publisher:** Annapurna Interactive
- **Release Date:** 2021-09-28 (DLC)
- **Platforms:** PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series
- **Price (Launch):** $14.99
- **Price (Current):** $14.99
- **Genre Tags:** DLC, expansion, horror, exploration, puzzle

### Performance
- **Estimated Revenue (Lifetime):** $10M-$15M (DLC only, all platforms)
- **Estimated Units Sold:** 800K-1.2M copies (DLC)
- **Metacritic Score:** 84/100 (PC)
- **Steam Reviews:** ~8,500 reviews, 91% positive
- **DLC attach rate:** ~40-50% of base game owners

### Key Features
1. New explorable location (The Stranger) with its own mystery
2. Horror elements not present in the base game
3. 6-10 hours of additional content
4. Expanded lore connecting to the base game's themes
5. New puzzle mechanics unique to the DLC

### Strengths
- Proved the audience wanted more after a "complete" experience
- Horror pivot showed creative ambition and kept content fresh
- High attach rate demonstrates strong audience loyalty

- Expanded the game's cultural relevance two years after launch

### Weaknesses

- Stealth sections frustrated players who loved the base game's freedom
- Accessibility complaints (dark environments, jump scares)
- Hard to market without spoiling the base game

### Differentiators (vs. Infinite Voyage)
- Infinite Voyage plans post-launch content from the start; Outer Wilds
  DLC was developed opportunistically
- Infinite Voyage's structure (multiple star systems) naturally supports
  expansion content without bolting on new areas

### Lessons Learned for Post-Launch Planning
- A 40-50% DLC attach rate is achievable for beloved indie games
- Post-launch content should add new mechanics, not just new areas
- Plan expansion hooks into the base game architecture from day one
- DLC can generate 25-35% of the base game's lifetime revenue
- A 2-year gap between base and DLC is viable if the content is high quality

## 8. Positioning Statement

Based on the competitor analysis above, Infinite Voyage's competitive
positioning is:

> "Infinite Voyage occupies the underserved intersection of hand-crafted
> space exploration and deep narrative RPG systems. It offers the discovery
> magic of Outer Wilds, the narrative depth of Disco Elysium, the focused
> scope of Citizen Sleeper, and the galactic scale that Starfield attempted
> but diluted through procedural generation. No current title combines all
> four qualities."

Use this positioning to anchor the competitive slide in every pitch deck
variant.
