# Game Pitch Presentation Guide

How to structure, deliver, and survive a game pitch meeting. This guide covers
elevator pitches, full deck presentations, and the Q&A gauntlet that follows.

---

## 1. The Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)

Every pitch starts here. If you cannot explain the game in 30 seconds, the
full deck will not save you.

### Structure: One Sentence Formula

```
[Game Title] is a [genre] game where you [core verb] [compelling object]
in [setting] to [goal/stakes].
```

### Infinite Voyage Example

> "Infinite Voyage is a narrative-driven space exploration RPG where you
> explore the ruins of an ancient cosmic civilization across uncharted star
> systems, making choices that reshape the future of the galaxy."

### Rules for Elevator Pitches

1. Lead with the player fantasy, not the feature list.
2. Name the genre so the listener has an anchor.
3. Include one unique differentiator (the thing no other game does).
4. End with stakes or emotional hook (why should they care?).
5. Practice until it sounds natural, not rehearsed.

### Common Failures

- Too long (over 45 seconds means you do not know your game).
- Too generic ("it's an RPG with combat and exploration").
- Too technical ("we use procedural generation with wave function collapse").
- No hook (nothing that makes the listener ask "tell me more").

---

## 2. Hook-Problem-Solution Framework

The first three slides of any pitch follow this narrative arc.

### Slide 1: The Hook

Open with the single most compelling thing about your game. This is not
"hello, we are Studio X." This is the moment that makes people lean forward.

**Formats that work:**
- A striking piece of concept art with a one-line tagline
- A 15-second gameplay clip that shows the core fantasy
- A provocative question ("What if the ruins you explore are watching you back?")
- A bold claim ("The first space RPG where your archaeology changes history")

**What to avoid:**
- Studio introduction (save it for slide 10)
- Agenda slides (nobody cares about your outline)
- Lengthy context-setting

### Slide 2: The Problem

Identify the gap in the market or player experience that your game fills.

**Template:**
> "Players love [existing genre/experience], but current games
> [fail in specific way]. There is no game that [your unique proposition]."

**Infinite Voyage Example:**
> "Space exploration games focus on combat or sandbox survival. Players who
> want narrative depth, meaningful discovery, and choices with consequences
> have no home in the space genre."

### Slide 3: The Solution

Present your game as the answer to the problem.

> "Infinite Voyage combines the exploration of Outer Wilds with the narrative
> branching of Disco Elysium, set in a hand-crafted galaxy of ancient mysteries."

Use a comparison formula when helpful:
> "[Known Game A] meets [Known Game B] with [your twist]."

But never rely on comparisons alone. Follow up with what makes yours distinct.

## 3. Competitive Positioning

### Positioning Map

Create a 2x2 matrix that places your game in a favorable quadrant:

```
             Narrative Depth
                  HIGH
                   |
    Disco Elysium  |  INFINITE VOYAGE
                   |
   LOW ------------|------------- HIGH
   Combat Focus    |         Exploration Focus
                   |
    Destiny 2      |  No Man's Sky
                   |
                  LOW
```

Choose axes where your game occupies an underserved quadrant.

### Comparable Titles Slide

List 3-5 games. For each:
- Title and genre
- What it does well that you learn from
- What gap it leaves that you fill

Do not trash competitors. Respect them and show how you build on their work.

## 4. Market Sizing

### TAM / SAM / SOM

| Term | Definition | Infinite Voyage Example |
|---|---|---|
| TAM (Total Addressable Market) | Everyone who plays games in your broad category | $15B global RPG market |
| SAM (Serviceable Available Market) | Players on your platforms who play your sub-genre | $2.3B narrative RPGs on PC/console |
| SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) | Realistic first-year revenue based on comparables | $5M-$15M based on comp title performance |

### Rules for Market Slides

1. Always show the funnel from TAM down to SOM. Showing only TAM is a red flag.
2. Source your numbers (Steam Spy, VG Insights, Newzoo, NPD).
3. Show growth trends (year-over-year increases in your sub-genre).
4. Connect market size to your specific title's revenue potential.
5. Never claim you will capture more than 1-2% of SAM without extraordinary
   justification.

## 5. Team Credibility

### What Decision-Makers Evaluate

1. **Relevant experience:** Has anyone on the team shipped a similar game?
2. **Track record:** Did previous projects succeed commercially?
3. **Completeness:** Do you have all critical roles filled (design, engineering,
   art, production)?
4. **Stability:** How long has the team worked together?
5. **Passion:** Does the team genuinely love this game?

### How to Present Team

- Show 3-5 key leaders (not the entire org chart).
- One line of credentials each (studio name, shipped title, years of experience).
- If the team is new, emphasize individual experience from prior studios.
- If you have advisors with clout, list them.
- Include a team photo if you have one -- it humanizes the pitch.

### Addressing Team Gaps

If you are missing a key role, address it proactively:

> "We are currently hiring a Lead Animator. Our advisor [Name] from [Studio]
> is guiding our animation pipeline until the role is filled."

Pretending the gap does not exist destroys credibility.

## 6. The Ask / Terms

### Be Explicit

State exactly what you need:

- **Funding amount:** "$2.5M over 18 months"
- **What it covers:** "12-person team for 18 months through launch"
- **What you offer in return:** "Publishing rights, revenue share, equity stake"
- **Timeline:** "Alpha in 9 months, launch in 18 months"

### Common Ask Structures

| Deal Type | Publisher Ask | Investor Ask |
|---|---|---|
| Publishing deal | "We seek a publishing partner for marketing, distribution, and $2.5M dev funding" | N/A |
| Equity investment | N/A | "We are raising $3M at a $10M pre-money valuation" |
| Revenue share | "We propose 70/30 rev share (developer/publisher) post-recoup" | "Projected 3x return within 3 years" |
| Platform exclusivity | "6-month timed exclusive for [platform] in exchange for $X" | N/A |

### What Not to Do

- Do not say "we are flexible on terms" -- it signals desperation.
- Do not skip the ask -- they will wonder why you are there.
- Do not ask for "whatever you think is fair" -- know your worth.
- Do not inflate projections to justify the ask -- savvy investors see through it.

## 8. Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Starting with studio history | Nobody cares until they care about the game | Lead with the hook |
| Reading slides aloud | Signals you do not know your material | Speak to the slide, not from it |
| Too many slides | Decision fatigue kills interest | 10-15 slides for a 10-min pitch max |
| No gameplay footage | "Trust us, it's fun" does not work | Show a prototype, vertical slice, or animated mock-up |
| Vague market claims | "$100B gaming industry" means nothing specific | Funnel down to SOM with sources |
| No ask | They wonder why you are in the room | Explicit ask on a dedicated slide |
| Defensive Q&A responses | Makes you seem insecure | Acknowledge, reframe, answer |
| Comparing to AAA without AAA budget | Signals naivety | Compare to indie/AA successes in your niche |
| Ignoring competition | Suggests you have not done homework | Show 3-5 comps and your differentiation |
| Overtime | Disrespects the audience and signals poor planning | Rehearse with a timer, cut ruthlessly |

## 9. Q&A Preparation

### Anticipate These Questions

Every game pitch faces a predictable set of challenges. Prepare answers for
all of them before you walk into the room.

**Market & Business:**
- "How big is the market for this?" (Have TAM/SAM/SOM ready)
- "Who are your competitors?" (Positioning map)
- "What are your revenue projections?" (Backup slide with conservative/mid/bull)
- "What if the market shifts?" (Contingency plan)

**Game & Design:**
- "What makes this different from [Game X]?" (Clear differentiators)
- "How long is the game?" (Specific hours with justification)
- "What is the core loop?" (Diagram or 1-sentence summary)
- "Have you playtested?" (Data, quotes, or honest "not yet, here's the plan")

**Team & Execution:**
- "Have you shipped a game before?" (Track record or transferable experience)
- "What is your biggest risk?" (Honest answer with mitigation plan)
- "What happens if you run out of money?" (Runway and contingency)
- "Why should we bet on this team?" (Passion + experience + commitment)

**Technical:**
- "What engine?" (One sentence, not a tech lecture)
- "What platforms?" (Launch platforms + post-launch plans)
- "What is your tech risk?" (Honest assessment)

### Q&A Behavioral Rules

1. Pause before answering. Silence shows confidence.
2. Restate the question if it was unclear. It buys time and shows listening.
3. Answer in 30-60 seconds. Long answers lose the room.
4. If you do not know, say "Great question. I don't have that data today, but
   I will follow up by [date]." Then actually follow up.
5. Never argue. Acknowledge the concern, provide your perspective, move on.
6. Track every question asked. They reveal what your deck is missing.
