# Storytelling Techniques for Game Pitches

How to make decision-makers feel the game before they see a single line of code.
This guide covers narrative techniques specifically designed for pitching games,
not for writing games (that is the narrative designer's job).

---

## 1. The Player Fantasy

The player fantasy is the emotional experience the player imagines having before
they ever press Start. It is the single most important thing to communicate in
a pitch because it answers the question every listener is silently asking:
"What does it feel like to play this?"

### Defining the Player Fantasy

Ask: "When the player describes this game to a friend, what do they say?"

**Weak fantasy:**
> "You explore space and fight enemies and collect stuff."

**Strong fantasy:**
> "You are a lone archaeologist deciphering the ruins of a civilization that
> vanished a million years ago. Every ruin you explore reveals a piece of
> the puzzle. Every choice you make reshapes the fate of the galaxy. You feel
> like an interstellar Indiana Jones solving the greatest mystery in the cosmos."

### Fantasy Formula

```
You are [identity].
You [core action] in [setting].
The stakes are [consequence].
You feel [emotional state].
```

### Rules for Pitching the Fantasy

1. Use second person ("you are", "you discover") to place the listener in
   the game.
2. Anchor to a known archetype (explorer, detective, commander, survivor).
3. Emphasize emotion over mechanics ("you feel the weight of the decision"
   not "you select option A or B").
4. Keep it to 3-4 sentences. If the fantasy needs a paragraph to explain,
   it is too complicated.

## 2. Emotional Hooks

Facts inform. Emotions persuade. A pitch that only describes mechanics is a
feature list. A pitch that makes the listener feel something is a story.

### The Five Emotional Hooks for Games

| Hook | Trigger | Infinite Voyage Example |
|---|---|---|
| Wonder | Reveal something vast, beautiful, or mysterious | "You land on a planet and see a city that has been silent for a million years" |
| Tension | Create uncertainty with stakes | "Your oxygen is running out and the exit is on the other side of the ruin" |
| Discovery | Reward curiosity with knowledge | "You decode an ancient inscription that rewrites everything you thought you knew" |
| Agency | Give the player meaningful power | "You choose whether to share this technology with humanity or destroy it" |
| Connection | Build emotional bonds with characters | "Your AI companion has been with you since the first planet. It remembers everything." |

### Using Hooks in Slides

Each key slide should trigger one hook:

- **Opening Hook slide:** Wonder or Tension
- **Gameplay slide:** Agency or Discovery
- **Narrative slide:** Connection or Wonder
- **Ask slide:** Tension ("The window for this opportunity is closing")

### Ordering for Maximum Impact

Start with Wonder (big, beautiful, awe-inspiring).
Move to Discovery (what makes this game unique).
Build to Agency (why the player's choices matter).
Close with Tension (what is at stake if this game does not get made).

## 3. Unique Selling Points (USP)

### What Makes a USP

A unique selling point is not a feature. It is the intersection of a feature
and a player benefit that no competitor provides.

| Feature (Not a USP) | USP (Feature + Benefit + Uniqueness) |
|---|---|
| "Turn-based combat" | "Tactical combat where ancient technology you discover mid-fight changes your abilities permanently" |
| "Open world exploration" | "Hand-crafted star systems where every planet holds a piece of a galaxy-spanning mystery" |
| "Branching narrative" | "Your archaeological discoveries determine which civilizations rise or fall across the galaxy" |

### USP Communication Framework

For each USP, prepare:

1. **The headline** (one sentence, slide title)
2. **The proof** (gameplay footage, concept art, or design detail)
3. **The comparison** (how competitors handle this, and why yours is better)
4. **The player impact** (what the player feels or experiences because of this)

### How Many USPs to Pitch

Three. More than three and none of them feel special. Fewer than two and the
game does not feel differentiated. Present three strong USPs and let the
listener remember them.

## 4. Gameplay-First Narratives

Game pitches fail when the story is presented as a movie plot instead of a
player experience. Always frame narrative through gameplay.

### Bad: Story as Plot Summary

> "In the year 2847, Dr. Lyra Chen discovers an alien signal that leads her
> to the Kepler Sector where she finds ruins of the Architects, an ancient
> civilization. She must uncover why they vanished while dealing with rival
> factions and cosmic threats."

### Good: Story as Player Experience

> "You receive a signal from deep space -- coordinates to a ruin no one has
> ever seen. When you arrive, the ruin reacts to your presence. It has been
> waiting. Every ruin you explore after that teaches you more about the
> Architects, but also reveals that you are not the first person they chose.
> You decide what to do with what you learn. Factions are watching. The galaxy
> is listening."

### The Difference

Plot summaries describe what happens to a character. Gameplay narratives
describe what the player does and feels. In a pitch, always choose the latter.

### Narrative-Mechanic Pairings

For each story beat, show how it manifests as gameplay:

| Story Beat | Gameplay Expression |
|---|---|
| Discovering the ancient signal | Tutorial mission: track the signal across 3 star systems |
| Learning Architect language | Puzzle mechanic: decode inscriptions using fragments you collect |
| Rival faction confrontation | Dialogue system: negotiate, deceive, or fight |
| The truth about the Architects | Late-game revelation that recontextualizes early discoveries |
| Player's final choice | Branching ending determined by accumulated decisions |

## 5. Show, Don't Tell

### The Hierarchy of Proof

From weakest to strongest, here is how you can demonstrate your game in a pitch:

1. **Description only** (weakest): "The combat is tactical and deep."
2. **Concept art**: A beautiful illustration of the combat scenario.
3. **Animated mock-up**: A motion graphic simulating the gameplay.
4. **Prototype footage**: Actual gameplay from a rough build.
5. **Vertical slice footage** (strongest): Polished gameplay representing final quality.

### What to Show at Each Stage

| Development Stage | What You Have | How to Show It |
|---|---|---|
| Concept only | Written design, mood boards | Concept art + animated mock-up |
| Pre-production | Paper prototypes, greybox | Greybox footage + concept art overlay |
| Prototype | Playable build, programmer art | Prototype footage + art targets |
| Vertical slice | Polished segment | Gameplay trailer from the slice |
| Alpha+ | Feature-complete build | Live demo or polished trailer |

### Video Guidelines for Pitches

- **Length:** 30-90 seconds per clip. Never more than 2 minutes total.
- **Quality:** Capture at 1080p minimum. 60fps if the game runs at 60.
- **Audio:** Game audio or music only. No voiceover on the video itself
  (you provide the voiceover live).
- **Editing:** Cut to the most exciting moments. Do not show menus, loading
  screens, or walking between objectives.
- **Fallback:** Always have the video embedded in the slide AND a backup file
  on a USB drive. Technology will fail at the worst moment.

## 6. Demo Strategies

### When to Offer a Live Demo

Live demos are high-risk, high-reward. Only offer one when:

- The build is stable (no crashes in 50+ consecutive runs)
- You can complete the demo in under 5 minutes
- The demo showcases your strongest USP
- You have a video backup if the demo fails

### Demo Structure

1. **Setup** (15 seconds): "Let me show you what this looks like in action."
2. **Core fantasy moment** (60-90 seconds): The best thing the game does.
3. **Player choice moment** (30-60 seconds): Show agency and consequence.
4. **Wow moment** (15-30 seconds): End on a high note -- reveal, explosion,
   twist, beautiful vista.
5. **Transition back** (10 seconds): "And that's just the first hour."

### If the Demo Crashes

1. Do not panic. Do not apologize excessively.
2. Say: "And that's live development for you. Let me show you the same
   sequence in our trailer." Switch to video backup.
3. Laugh about it. Audiences respect honesty over perfection.
4. Address it in follow-up: "We've identified and fixed the issue from the
   demo. Here is a clean capture."

## 7. Trailer Scripting

### Pitch Trailer vs. Marketing Trailer

| Aspect | Pitch Trailer | Marketing Trailer |
|---|---|---|
| Audience | Publishers, investors | Players, press |
| Length | 60-90 seconds | 90-180 seconds |
| Focus | Core mechanic + fantasy | Hype + breadth of content |
| Narrator | Optional, understated | Often dramatic |
| CTA | "Let's discuss partnership" | "Wishlist now" |

### Pitch Trailer Script Template

```
[0-5s]   Black screen. One line of text or sound.
         Purpose: Create anticipation.

[5-15s]  The world reveal. Wide shot of the game's setting.
         Purpose: Establish tone and visual quality.

[15-30s] The core mechanic in action. Show the verb.
         Purpose: "This is what you do in this game."

[30-45s] Discovery or narrative moment. Show depth.
         Purpose: "This game has more than surface-level action."

[45-55s] Escalation. The stakes get higher. Show consequence.
         Purpose: "Choices matter. The world reacts."

[55-65s] Montage of variety. Quick cuts of different environments,
         encounters, characters.
         Purpose: "There is a lot of game here."

[65-75s] Logo reveal. Game title, studio name.
         Purpose: Brand identification.

[75-80s] Tagline. One sentence that sticks.
         Purpose: Memorability.
```

### Music and Sound

- Use music that matches the game's emotional tone, not generic trailer music.
- Key moments should hit on musical beats (the reveal, the title card).
- Keep dialogue minimal. If you include it, make it iconic and short.
- Sound design sells immersion: alien atmospherics, ship engines, ancient
  technology activating.

## 8. Adapting the Story for Different Audiences

### Publishers

Publishers want to know the game will sell. Frame the story as a market
opportunity:

> "Narrative RPGs are growing 12% year-over-year. Infinite Voyage gives
> players the story depth of Disco Elysium in the aspirational setting of
> a space epic."

### Investors

Investors want returns. Frame the story as IP potential:

> "Infinite Voyage's lore has built-in franchise potential: sequels, prequels,
> transmedia. The Architects mythology supports a 10-year content roadmap."

### Team

The team wants to build something they are proud of. Frame the story as
creative ambition:

> "This is our chance to make the space game we always wished existed. The
> kind of game where players message each other at 2 AM saying 'did you find
> the ruin on the third moon?'"

### Press

Press wants a story to tell. Frame the game as a headline:

> "From ex-BioWare developers: a space archaeology RPG where your discoveries
> rewrite galactic history."

## 9. Storytelling Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "The Lore Dump" | 5 minutes of world-building before gameplay | Lead with gameplay, weave in lore |
| "The Feature Parade" | Listing mechanics without connecting to emotion | Pair every feature with a player feeling |
| "The Movie Pitch" | Telling the story as a film plot | Frame through player verbs and choices |
| "The Apology" | "It's early, but imagine if..." | Show what you have confidently |
| "The Kitchen Sink" | Trying to communicate everything | Pick 3 beats. Leave them wanting more. |
| "The Cliche" | "In a world where..." | Open with something specific and surprising |
| "The Comparison Crutch" | "It's like Dark Souls meets Stardew Valley" | Comparisons support, they do not replace identity |

---

## 10. The One Thing Rule

If the audience remembers only one thing after your pitch, what should it be?

Define this before you build a single slide. Write it on a card and tape it
to your monitor. Every slide, every sentence, every image must serve or at
least not contradict this one thing.

**Infinite Voyage's One Thing:**
> "You are an archaeologist unraveling the greatest mystery in the galaxy,
> and your choices determine what humanity becomes."

If a slide does not connect to this, cut it or rework it.
