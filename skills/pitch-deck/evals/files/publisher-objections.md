# Infinite Voyage — Anticipated Publisher Objections

## Objection 1: "The space exploration market is oversaturated"
**Context:** Publishers have seen dozens of space-themed indie pitches. No Man's Sky, Starfield, and Kerbal Space Program dominate the conversation. Publishers worry there is no room for another space game.

**Their likely phrasing:**
- "We've already passed on three space games this quarter."
- "What makes this different from No Man's Sky or Outer Wilds?"
- "The space genre feels crowded right now."

## Objection 2: "Your team has no shipped titles"
**Context:** The studio is relatively new. While team members have individual AAA credits, the studio itself has not shipped a commercial product together. Publishers see this as execution risk.

**Their likely phrasing:**
- "How do we know you can actually ship this?"
- "Your team has great resumes, but this studio has no track record."
- "What happens if your lead programmer leaves mid-project?"

## Objection 3: "The budget is too high for an unproven IP"
**Context:** Requesting $2.5M+ for a new IP from a new studio is a significant ask. Publishers compare this to lower-budget titles that found success with $500K-$1M budgets.

**Their likely phrasing:**
- "Can you scope this down to $1M?"
- "We typically fund new IPs at a lower tier. What is the minimum viable version?"
- "Your comparable titles (Outer Wilds, FTL) were made for a fraction of this budget."

## Objection 4: "Single-player narrative games have limited revenue ceilings"
**Context:** Publishers increasingly favor games-as-a-service, live service, or multiplayer titles with recurring revenue. A single-player narrative RPG with a finite playtime has a one-time purchase model and limited DLC potential.

**Their likely phrasing:**
- "What is your live service strategy?"
- "How do you plan to monetize beyond the initial sale?"
- "We are prioritizing titles with recurring revenue potential."

## Objection 5: "Your timeline is too aggressive"
**Context:** 18-month development cycle for a game of this scope is tight. Publishers have been burned by delays and want confidence in realistic timelines.

**Their likely phrasing:**
- "Every indie studio says 18 months, and it always takes 3 years."
- "What is your contingency plan for delays?"
- "Can you show me a detailed project plan with risk mitigation?"
