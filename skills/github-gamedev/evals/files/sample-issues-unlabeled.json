Load test scene with damage source\n2. Take shield damage, measure regen delay with frame timer\n3. Measure regen rate over 30-second window\n4. Repeat for each difficulty\n5. Test with shield upgrade modules installed\n\n## Expected\n- All values within 5% of design spec\n- No regen during active damage frames\n- Upgrade modules apply multiplicative bonus correctly"

This hazard should create interesting routing decisions on the star map and tactical challenges during real-time traversal.\n\n## Objective\nGravity wells pull ships off course and drain FTL fuel. Players must decide whether to navigate around (longer, safer) or punch through (shorter, risky).\n\n## Deliverables\n- [ ] Mechanics doc: pull strength formula, fuel drain rate, escape velocity threshold\n- [ ] Risk/reward matrix: fuel saved vs. hull damage probability by ship class\n- [ ] Integration notes for star map pathfinding algorithm\n- [ ] Suggested VFX and audio cues for proximity warning\n\n## Open Questions\n- Should gravity wells be visible on the star map before discovery?\n- Can ship upgrades provide gravity resistance?\n- How do gravity wells interact with the Void Engine Phase Shift ability?"
